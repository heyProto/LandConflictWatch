They also said for the past fortnight, authorities have been assuring them that land will be provided soon but no decision has been taken and officials asked them to dump garbage on vacant land. Residents of Zirakpur held a protest against the municipal council for not providing them proper garbage disposal in the town.

In the mahapanchayat it was decided the field belongs to the village and it will be given for kids to play. Ghamroj has recently emerged as a budding nursery for Indian football, having produced several national-level players, including 10 who have played for different professional clubs across the country in the I-League.

On 19th March 2018, a Bench headed by judicial member Jawad Rahim on Wednesday issued show cause notices to the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, the Gujarat State Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) and the State Forest Department. The petition says that the destruction of mangroves not only violates the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 and Coastal Regulatory Zone Notification, 2011 but also deprives the indigenous Kharai camel species of its major food source, thereby affecting the livelihoods of several hundred camel breeders of the region. KCBA president Bhikhabhai Rabari claimed that the saltpan lease holders have blocked the creek as a result mangroves are devoid of seawater. Earlier, they used to work outside the creek area, but now they produce salt inside the creek where dense mangroves are present. Despite the NGT’s order and cancellation of lease by the Kutch District collector, work has not halted. On 7th April, the camel breeders submitted a memorandum to Deendayal Port Trust (DPT) against salt production and leasing of saltpans. Camel breeders from Bhachau to Gandhidham having 700 camels are suffering as food for the animal has become scarce.",

The villagers are demanding jobs in the cement factory for the unemployed people of that area. They also demanded reservation in medical, engineering and supervisory posts for the local tribal youth. Moreover, the angry protesters have threatened the government for not casting their votes in the assembly elections if the government does not return their land. One of the Adivasi leaders while addressing the villagers said that “the land belongs to SC/ST and the Indian Constitution provides special restriction that the land belonging to the scheduled caste or scheduled tribe cannot be bought by a non-tribal.” Prashant Patidar, who was part of the protest, said why fresh acquisition of land is being carried out which will displace hundreds of people, when hundreds of acre of land acquired for Dhar Cement is lying vacant. “The vacant land should be given for the new cement factory instead of acquiring fresh land,” he said. Meera of Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA) alleged that “as per the rule to set up any project they need to get approval from the people of the area. But here, in this case, Gram Sabha had passed a resolution opposing the proposed cement factory.” “They even fail to produce documents related to approval from Ministry of Environment and Forest for the project and they don’t even have approval from the planning commission,” alleged Meera. The protests also demand that after the passing of new Land Acquisition Act 2013, all the process of land acquisition need to be done under the new law. The villagers state that the administration is trying to take their land under the old land acquisition act.Hundreds of villagers took out the rally at Main Street of Manawar and reached the SDM office and demanded to clear the stand of government over land acquisition.",

Malviya also said that the minority community has lo st the casein the High Court and Lower Court following which the landowner demolished the unauthorized construction and even after losing the Court cases, the missionaries were not vacating the encroached area. He also said that the district administration has marked out the areas which are owned by both the parties. He further maintained that neither the owner nor his men attacked nurses. On the other hand, the Catholics are shocked about the attack on them. With such repeated attacks on Christian institutions, the minorities feel unsafe as Archbishop of Bhopal, Leo Cornelio strongly condemned the attack and further call it a systematic planning to create disturbance and violence. The hospital staff was also surprised as the local cops and other senior officials didn’t respond to them. Bishop Vadakkel told the news reporter that even staff nurses, who approached the women's police station to lodge a complaint, were turned away.

Local Trinamool leader Nantu was the key person who took paddy lands on lease and turned them into temporary bheris by letting in saline water through canals. The water in rivers close to the coast are brackish because sea water enters during high tide and Some people of the village cultivate shrimp fish in these salt waters. salty water seeps into the cultivable land and affects the paddy which grows better in sweet water.

    "summary":"Bhanubhai Vankar, a 61-year-old Dalit activist died on 16th February 2018, a day after setting himself ablaze outside the collector’s office in Patan. Hailing from Unjha town of Mehsana district, Vankar was fighting for the land rights of two Dalit laborers who alleged that authorities were refusing to regularize the 18-acre land allotment despite collecting Rs 22,236 from them in 2013 for the transfer. Vankar's death triggered protests in various parts of Gujarat including Patan, Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar, Junagadh, Banaskantha, and Surendranagar.Bhanubhai’s family refused to take his body until their demands were fulfilled, including allotment of land, action against the guilty officials and formation of a special investigation team to probe his death. Another Dalit, Kailashben, a resident of Panchasar village in Patan district tried to commit suicide by immolating herself on 18th February 2018 as a mark of protest over the land rights issue. She is currently undergoing treatment for her burn injuries. The Gujarat Government announced that the ownership title of the land would be given to the two Dalits for whom Vankar was fighting on the evening of 17th February 2018. Jignesh Mevani, independent legislator and other Dalit members, however, continued their protest saying that they wanted a written directive from the state government to fulfill the land right demands of Dalits. Apart from Mevani, Patel Anamat Andolan Samiti leader Hardik Patel, Congress MLA Alpesh Thakor and Congress Leader of Opposition Paresh Dhanani came together on Saturday to support the Vankar family.",

    "summary":"Five Dalit families from Gitapura village of Detroj taluka in Ahmedabad district have been sitting on a protest outside Detroj mamlatdar office, during the first week of Jan 2018, seeking residential plots that the Gram Panchayat of the village has been denying them on the ground that they are not residents of the village. Several people from the Patidar community, who do not want Dalits owning land in the village, also camped at the mamlatdar office in protest. The Dalits demanding land are listed as residents of Bhagapura village, which was part of a group village panchayat. In 2011, Gitapura and Bhagapura were separated into different village panchayat. The five families, comprising 30 members, have been camping outside Detroj mamlatdar office since January 16. The five Dalit families claim that in 2013, Bhagapura gram panchayat had passed a resolution to give them plots in the geographical part which is now Gitapura. However, the revenue survey numbers of the two villages stayed together and their separation was done only in 2015 as per which the disputed site where the Dalit families have been living came under the jurisdiction of Gitapura village. And, now, the authorities of Gitapura village are calling the Dalits’ settlement “an encroachment” and want them to be evicted from their village as they are technically residents of Bhagapura and not Gitapura. sarpanch of Gitapura gram panchayat, Ramesh Patel said that the resolution giving plots to Dalits in Gitapura village was passed by Bhagapura village panchayat is not acceptable to them and they have got that resolution cancelled from the Taluka Development Officer (TDO). Dalit youth leader and Vadgam MLA Jignesh Mevani met the protesting Dalits at Detroj mamlatdar office on 11th Jan, 2018. Mevani-led Rashtriya Dalit Adhikar Manch (RDAM) handed over a memorandum to Ahmedabad Collectorate, seeking resolution of the Dalits’ demand, on 12th Jan 2018. As a result, Dalit families have been promised that they can convert their agricultural land in Gitapura as non-agricultural to build houses. However, this land dispute case has thrown up a challenge to the political comradeship between Jignesh Mevani and Patidar leader Hardik Patel, who have been exhorting opposition parties in the country to unite against the BJP. In a Facebook post, Hardik Patel has referred to the protesting Dalits as “anti-socials” and “gundas”. On December 14, 2013, Patidars had allegedly physically attacked one of the Dalits, Narshibhai Maganbhai Parmar, who was seriously injured. Their huts were set on fire. Women were forced to walk two kilometers to fetch a pail of water.",

Archaeologists say, this is the second most important Harappan site after Dholavira in Gujarat. But villagers are not interested in such excavation that cost them displacement from their homes and land. The protests began late last month after the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) sent eviction notices to 201 villagers. A khap panchayat in Haryana’s Hisar district will hold a protest march in Narnaund town to oppose efforts of authorities to remove 201 structures, mostly houses in neighboring Rakhigarhi village, which is described as the largest Harappan site. The notice sent by ASI to villagers stated that, villagers have 'encroached' the land but villagers claim that in 1986 village panchayat had alloted them this shamlat (common land). The villagers said they would continue their dharna until the government de-notifies the land where they have constructed their houses. The number of people and land affected area is not known.",

Protesting villagers have been sitting on fast since last one week in front of Rajula Mamlatdar’s office demanding back their land, which was leased to GHCL for salt production.

The villagers either want their land back or they demand that the salt pans should be handed over to village co-operative society so that they can get employment. GHCL has filed its renewal application in prescribed time and it is pending with the state government. There are nearly 12,500 saltpans along the coastal belt of Kutch and Little Rann of Kutch (LRK) and lease of nearly 80% of these pans has not been renewed for a decade. The saltpan leaseholders blame the state government policy for creating obstacles in the renewal process. The state government had started allotting land on lease for salt production in 1964.

    "summary":"Gujarat Power Corporation Limited (GPCL) had acquired 2,059 hectares of land of nearly a dozen villages in Gogha taluka in the 1990s for the purpose of setting up a 2X250MW lignite-based thermal power plant. The plant is to be set up by Bhavnagar Energy Company Limited (BECL) and promoted by GPCL at Padra village of Ghogha taluka. However, with the government seeking possession of the land after over two decades, the farmers have been taken aback. The protesting farmers who have been cultivating this land claim that it is very fertile. They further alleged that BECL also wanted to acquire village pasture land, which is not permissible under the law. The GPCL had acquired land in two batches — 1,355 hectare in Ghogha-Surka block and 704 hectares of Kharliya block in the late 1990s for the power plant. However, the company did not start the work and the land continued to be cultivated by original owners. The government has acquired the land in Badi, Padva, Hoidal, Malekvadar, Morsal, Thoradi, Rampar, Surka, Alapar, Khadasaliya, Thadsar and Lakhanka villages. On April 1, farmers clashed with the GPCL team and police in Padva and Badi villages, forcing the cops to lob at least 40 teargas shells and resort to lathicharge. 50 farmers were detained by the Police. The GPCL team had gone there with earth movers to begin mining of lignite. The farmers wanted GPCL to wait till the High Court disposes of the matter. As a mark of protest, on April 3, 2018, parents of around 900 children withdrew the admission of their wards from school. The villagers are of the opinion that after their land is acquired, they will have to do the odd labour jobs and wouldn’t be able to fund the education of their children. They have submitted applications seeking school leaving certificates. In December 2017, around 100 farmers from 12 villages of Gogha taluka in Bhavnagar protested against the state government's move to take possession of their land. The farmers demanded that the land be returned to them or they be given compensation as per the current prevailing law. GPCL has reported in the media saying that the farmers were given compensation that was five times higher than the market rate two decades ago and that they have rights to land and also representation from the farmers. Around 2,000 farmers were protesting non-violently in Bedi against GPCL’s possession of land on 8th April. They had come with plans to give roses to police personnel and State Government officials. But the police used two rounds of teargas shells lobbed to disperse the gathered people.",

The NHAI wants to relocate the toll plaza some 11 km away from the existing one towards Sehrawan for which 65 acres of land has to be acquired and according to Manoharlal Khatta, the CM of Haryana, the land has been transferred to NHAI. But contrary to these claims, no land transfer has yet happened and the concerned 65 acres still belong to the Manesar Panchayat who are demanding the toll plaza to be relocated around 5km from Sehrawan towards Kundali-Manesar-Palwal Expressway which would save them 59 acres of land. This issue that has been pending for long and both the state and the central governments are under pressure to yield to the demand of residents to have the toll point relocated.",

A merchant establishment in Revdi Bazar has 455 shops and an additional 68-odd illegal extensions, is one such market complex to be affected. The merchants say that nearly 5,000 square metres of their total of 10,000 square metres of land would go into the project and associated road deduction. The project involves the acquisition of 89.81 hectares. Of this, 84.65 hectares is government land and 5.16 hectares private. A total of 1,047 properties will be affected, out of which 548 are residential, 351 commercial and 144 residential-cum-commercial. The remaining one is an industrial establishment. About 36 additional structures that are likely to be affected include 11 religious structures. This land was given to the society by the Union government for Sindhi settlers after Partition. They claim to have been in the wholesale business for decades and are now on the verge of losing their clientele and livelihoods. The society, therefore, had demanded 10,000 square metres at an open mill land nearby, to relocate the 60-year-old market. The Revdi Bazaar traders association has sent four reminders to the AMC about the issue. On 1st Jan 2018, Naroda MLA Balram Thawani led a delegation of 50 Sindhi community members including those from Revdi Bazaar to meet chief minister Vijay Rupani.

The displaced persons, along with others in the vicinity alleged that the CPWD had conducted the demolition. The issue came to light after the complaints of the displaced persons that no measures for relief and rehabilitation were taken by the concerned authorities. Moreover, they also alleged that they were not given prior notice of the demolition. While the CPWD claimed that the basti residents were given multiple notices, one of the residents claimed that the notices were meant only for a small portion of the plot. Many displaced persons are still living on the sides of Mata Sundari Lane in makeshift tents and encampments. According to them, some former residents are now living in rented accommodation in the neighbourhood, while most of them are unable to afford new accommodation and are thus living on the street. The most common grievance amongst the residents of kutta basti was that they had been living there for at least 35 years and had also paid electricity bills, water bills and even rent to the Waqf board. Dharampal, one of the residents, has maintained a file of all the records of the displaced persons which included bills and Aadhar Cards all made out to the address of the basti. If they had registered their addresses with the government for so decades, why demolish the basti now? At present, the plot of land on Mata Sundari Lane is full of debris from the demolition, while the DMC is building a wall around it. In addition, a small portion of the land has been allotted to the Art of Living Foundation of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, as claimed by a bunch of private contractors working on it.",

    "summary":"On 19th July 2017, 1200 flood affected families of Laika and Dodhia villages in the Tinsukia district of Assam encroached upon the Tarani Reserve Forest of Assam. The encroachment was heavily opposed by the residents of Pengeri and Phillobari villages. These villages lie at the entrance to the reserve forest. The Pengeri-Phillobari Budh Bazar Chariali was blocked by protesting village residents who had come out with sticks and machetes to prevent the encroachers from entering the forest. However, by the time the locals had been informed of the encroachment, the village residents of Laika and Dodhia had already built temporary shelters. About 686 of the affected people had already occupied the grounds of the nearby Bijulibon Primary School and sought refuge there. The Chief Minister of Assam, Sarbananda Sonowal held a closed door meeting at the district headquarters, Tinsukia with the district authorities, MLAs of Tinsukia, Digboi, Margherita, Sadia and Lahowal and concerned civil society groups. He sympathized with the plight of the flood-affected people but made it clear that the illegal squatters would not be allowed refuge at the Tarani Reserve Forest. The residents of Pengeri and Phillobari belong mostly to the Mising community. Rakesh Chetry, the circle officer of Margherita held a meeting with members of the Phillobari wing of the Takam Mising Porin Kebang (TMPK), a Mising students' organization and after long deliberations promised them that a survey would be conducted within eight months and all the illegal squatters would be moved to a different location.",

    "summary":"Land acquisition for the 125-km long Rishikesh-Karnaprayag railway line—out of which 110 km will pass through tunnels. Including 15.1 km India’s longest tunnel —began just after the new government in Uttarakhand lead by Tripendra Singh Rawat of the BJP was sworn in. Accordingly, 30839 ha Reserve Forestland, 110.316 Government Land and 169.918 private land was to be acquired and transferred to the Railways Development Corporation and soon the process for land acquiring began. For this, no-objection certificates were obtained from Women’s Hospital, Kathod village, Srinagar, Degree College, also from Kathod village, Srinagar, Degree College, Old Srinagar, GNTI, Old Srinagar and Poly-technique, Bhalgaon, Srinagar. High-tension wires of PITKUL are being shifted and notices have been issued to the land holders to acquire their lands. The CM was too keen to complete this process fast and he gave instructions to the officials for it in March itself, “There is a problem only for ten per cent land acquisition and we’ll solve it fast and all affected households will be resettled within two months,” he assured. And, the officials somehow completed the formality of a public-hearing under the chairmanship of Mukta Mishra, the DM at Dham Sumerpur village for the land acquisition in Punad, Tilani, Sumerpur and Ratura villages of Rudraprayag block. But, almost immediately people started protest in Dungaripanth village, just 12 km from Srinagar, as they pointed out that compensation rate that to be given is negligible and they demanded a house against their destroyed house and an assured job. “Now, they’ll pay us the compensation at four times of the circle rate, or Rs. 44.000 a nali (about 200 sq. m), but today, one nali land costs Rs. 5 lakhs,” says Shankar Prasad Bahuguna, a villager. “We have irrigated land that will be destroyed and the railways is not even giving us jobs,” rues Jaiveer Singh, another villager. The gram pradhan (village head), Dungaripanth village said, “Already, half-the-land was acquired by Srinagar Hydro-electricity Project and the remaining half will be usurped by this project and if the government doesn’t respect people’s sentiment, we will not let them build this line.” Five villages of Chamoli district, 12 of Pauri and 10 of Rudraprayag will be directly and indirectly affected by this project as massive amount of tunnelling and relentless blasting will destroy their fields and water sources and result in cracks in their homes as it will have 13 stations and will pass through 16 bridges and 16 tunnels. About 300 homes are on the periphery of the proposed rail line and the land acquisition process is in its last phase in which 48 homes of seven villages in Tehri district would be dismantled. This district is facing the largest portion of the rail line and lands of 13 villages from Dhalwala to Maletha are being acquired. Following is the total land being acquired: District: Tehri. Total villages: 13. Total land acquired: 49.915 ha. District: Pauri. Total villages: 17. Total land acquired: 32.993 ha. District: Rudraprayag. Total villages: 10. Total land acquired: 23.798 ha. District: Chamoli. Total villages: 5. Total land acquired: 77.260 ha. (total 190.966 ha) Besides, 49 houses in Pauri district, 90 in Chamoli, 113 in Rudraprayag have been acquired, totalling 300 that will be destroyed. Overall, 45 villages with a total of 1,751 families thriving in Tehri, Pauri, Rudraprayag and Chamoli districts will be relocated. Still, homes in Ranihat and Naithana villages of Tehri district have yet to be acquired and for this, no-objection certificates have been demanded from the house owner.",

The eviction was supervised by the Additional Deputy Commissioner Nabadip Pathak, circle officers of the Dispur revenue circle, and officials of the Guwahati Municipal Corporation. A section of the encroachers protested against the move but their appeals were ignored. The authorities alleged that the encroachment on the drain had clogged it and worsened the already escalating flash floods in the city. In the same operation, makeshift houses along the Narengi railway line were also demolished. An eviction drive had been conducted in the same location in the past but the encroachers erected their shelters on the spot the very next day after the eviction.",

    "summary":"A section of tribals is incensed over the proposed expansion of World War II era airport in Dhalbhumgarh block of East Singhbhum district. Villages situated on the periphery of the airport have called for a meeting of gram sabha to arrive at a consensus on whether to part away with their land for the airport or not. Around three villages Kokepara, Debsole, and Burudih villages might face the displacement whip. Villagers of Debsole in gram sabha unanimously decided against giving their land for the development of proposed airport. “We have decided against the construction of the airport. The airport would lead to displacement of a lot of people,” Dakhin Hansda, village head and chairman of gram sabha said. Around 84 acres of land would be acquired for nearly 1100 acre of proposed airport. Airport Authority of India has given its consent and district administration has been directed to identify the status of the land. Administrative officials are planning to earmark and measure the available land. Villagers of Debsole have decided that they would not let the administration measure the land. Hansda pointed out that village residents around the WW II airports come under the fifth schedule that allows residents to decide on the land use. However, circle officer of Dhalmgarh, Harish Chandra Munda feels that prima facie only a few houses of Ruasole Village would be acquired. He also added that there might be a need for additional land for housing, hotels and allied infrastructure for the airport that may require the acquisition of more land. “At present, we feel that enough land is available and a dialogue would be held with agitating villagers,” he said. A large section of village residents is ready to give their land for the proposed airport if the government gives compensation and land. Construction work is likely to start in in 2018 and completion of the project is aimed at 2021.",

    "summary":"Sand mining in the Majri block of Mohali district is reported to have affected many villages. Media reports suggest that the residents of four villages--Khijrabaad, Kubbaheri, Hirdapur and Mianpur Jhangar-- are struggling to stop illegal mining in their region. Mining contractors have dug up the forest land near these villages, which has turned the land into ponds. According to Punjab Land Protection Act (PLPA), the forest land in these villages cannot be used for commercial purposes. Only agriculture is allowed. The affected farmers are finding it hard to farm the land because the entire area is full of deep pits created by minig. The farmers allege that the mining contractors are forcing them to sell their land. Farmers also fear that minimg may destroy the habitat of wild animals in forest and they might come toward the villages. Residents of Khijrabaad lodged a complaint in the office of Deputy Commissioner Gurpreet Kaur Sapra. She visited the villages on July 15. Residents have been protesting and pleading with the administration to stop illegal mining and also demand a 24 hour helpline to call whenever they come across any incident of illegal mining.",

Land, which was to be given to the GGIC was measured in the presence of all the concerned authorities. But, after the commencement of the construction work, contractors started building boundary walls encroaching upon the playground of the BRC. The encroachment led to a huge protest by many acknowledged teachers' federations of the region. These federations have warned the authorities that if the encroachment is not removed soon, teachers from across the region will demonstrate on the roads of Lucknow. For a very long time, the BRC has been supplying its ground for the public and collective meetings held by these federations.

    "summary":"At least 529 families, mostly tribal, are opposing construction of the Airport at Deoghar, Jharkhand. These families, currently living in Babupur, Bhitiya, Katia, Paharpur and Singhpur Yogidih villages, would be displaced to pave the way for construction of the airport. Altogether, around 13 villages would be affected by the project. The airport construction has started with tripartite agreement among the Defence Research and Development Organisation, Airport Authority of India and the Government of Jharkhand. Around Rs.350 crores would be invested in the project. The total area of the project would be around 656.79 acres. The government would acquire 437.70 acres raiyati (private) land, 144 acres of government land (including village common lands) and 18 acres of forest land to pave the way for the proposed airport. After Deoghar district administration started steps for land acquisition, villagers from Katia, Bhitia and Babupur Villages called their respective Gram Sabhas to build consensus over giving their land for the airport. Villagers in the Gram Sabhas decided against giving even an inch of land for the airport. Keeping in view the protest by the affected families, Deoghar district administration would soon initiate a public hearing. Officials from Airport Authority of India would also preside over the hearing to assess the grievances of the affected families. Sudhir Kumar, land acquisition officer of Deoghar accepts that the villagers are angry over the prospect of displacement. He points out that some of the families do not want to give their land while there are a few families that want compensation in the form of cash for their land. District administration has planned to shift the residents of Katia, Bhitia and Babupur to Nayadih. The administration had proposed a lump sum package of Rs 6.50 lakh for each displaced family. But a section of villagers want that the compensation package should include the value of their land. Another section of villagers is demanding the land value to be doubled as the market rate of the land has went up after the announcement of the construction of airport in the vicinity.",

The scam was carried out in Udhamsingh Nagar district of Uttarakhand for widening this national highway by about ten officials who were posted here between 2011 and 2014 as the landholders got 10 to 15 times the official compensations when their land was acquired as the land use change was carried out by the SDM and deputy collector rank officials. Local farmers were hoodwinked. When farmers of Kaliyanwala, Jaspur filed a PIL stating that agriculture land was taken away at throwaway prices and it was further changed to business land and thus this elaborate compensation was eked out, this scam was highlighted. Using this land change ploy, commission agents bought land from the farmers and got the huge amount of compensation in the connivance with the officials. Thus, the benefits were yielded not to the farmers, but to these agents and demanded a CBI inquiry into it. CBI inquiry has been ordered in the case.",

    "summary":"Residents of Alnar village came to know about the allocation of forest land near their village to the Raipur based Aarti Sponge and Power Limited in April 2017 when the company's surveyors reached the village. They soon figured that the land has been allotted without prior information and permission from the Gram Sabha. The land lies in the area covered under Panchayats Extension to Schedule Areas Act (PESA). The village residents held a meeting to discuss the matter. They wrote a letter to the President of India, Chief Justice of India, Justice of Chhattisgarh High Court, Governor of Chhattisgarh, Chairman National Schedule Tribes Commission and District Collector, to take action on the issue. The letter submitted at the Tehsiladr’s office in Bade Bacheli in Dantewada mentions the legal provisions i.e. Section-244(1) of the Indian Constitution which empowers the Schedule V areas for local self-governance and control under PESA and quoted the 1997 Supreme Court ruling according to which any mining lease in Schedule V area can be allotted to tribals only. Aarti Sponge and Power Limited got the mining lease for iron ore mining at Alnar village forest compartment no.416, 417&418 in the year 2011. For the first stage of environment clearance where the public hearing has to be organised, Terms of Reference were issued on 09 September 2016. After that a public hearing was organised on 30.09.2016 at the Van Kashtagar Mandal in Dantewada, also known as Forest department timber depot. The proceedings of this public hearing which were submitted at Chhattisgarh Environment Conservation board mentions that around 150 people attended the meeting and 91 signed the attendance register but there is no mention of people from Alnar village. When the Land Conflict Watch researcher interviewed a local resident journalist of the Alnar village, the journalist said that no public hearing notices were given to the residents of Alnar village. People who were present at the public hearing are suspected to have come from other villages. The forested hill which is allocated for mining belongs to two powerful persons of the tribe who provides their land for livelihood activities to the other members of the tribe and this is the cultural set up of the tribe. Although no mining activity has begun, residents of the village are certain that they do not want the mine because it will affect their livelihood.",

    "summary":"Tribal workers at Nilanchal Iron and Power Ltd are up in arms against the company’s decision to close the plant. The company acquired around 80 acres of land in Kandra for setting up the plant. The company, a subsidiary of Kolkata-based Jai Balaji Group had started operations in Ratanpur village of Kandra block in 2006. The company management also provided jobs to nearly 160 tribal youths whose families either donated their agricultural land or were affected by the plant’s operation. The company has decided to close the plant established at the cost of Rs 172 crores from the end of June. The closure notice was also put up on the plant’s gate. The notice created a furor among the workers especially those whose land were acquired for setting up the plant. According to Sumit Mandal, secretary of the company’s labor union, no consultation or opinion was taken from workers or the union on the closure of the unit. Mandal says, “Closure would lead to a lot of violence as there is no clarity over what will happen to the agricultural land acquired by the company.” Around 70 families who were completely dependent on agricultural land for their livelihood took the compensation package on the assurance that jobs would be given to them in the unit. Mandal also fears riot like situation if the company is closed indefinitely. Closure notice also mentions that workers would be given salary till the month of August and operations would close by June 30. Company’s general manager Gangadhar Bajpayee claims that company was established in 2005. However, due frequent protests and demonstrations at the plant’s gate, it remained closed from 2011 to 2015. “Operations have been not very smooth as production is disrupted by frequent protests over small issues. The company has suffered massive loss thus decision to close it has been taken,” he says. He also apprised that the closure and exit decision would be taken after consultation with the district administration. The issue of land ownership of acquired land would be taken in consultation with the labor union, district administration, and gram sabha.",

    "summary":"The Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) has initiated the process to relocate Maldharis or traditional cattle owners, who are living in various parts of the city, to the outskirts with their cattle. Maldharis are semi-nomadic and tend to live near grazing lands and sell the milk to earn a livelihood. RMC has registered 1658 Maldhari families who own about 20,000 cattle, to be relocated. Under the plan, each cattle owner would get 25 sqm land to construct a house and space to keep their cattle. The administration wants to mainstream maldharis, give them social security and make them a part of streamlined milk business. In the first phase, 561 maldhari families with 7,634 cattle are set to be relocated in the five villages--Bhichari-Amargadh, Maika, Padasan, Rajgadh and Lothva-- that already have a cattle population of about 21,000. The residents of these villages are against the relocation. On April 7th, 2017, they gathered at the Rajkot collectorate along with their cattle to oppose the relocation of maldharis in their villages. They submitted a memorandum to the Collector saying that relocation of maldharis will adversely affect their farming and livelihood. That the cattle of maldharis will destroy their crops. Allegedly, this land conflict is linked to caste issues. Most residents of these five villages are of high caste and don't want maldharis around because maldharis are supposed to belong to a lower caste.",

This proposal is being strongly opposed by environmentalists, farmers, current and former students of the college, the college alumni association, backed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Bharat Kisan Union and All India Association of Agriculture Graduates. They say that that this proposal will badly affect agricultural research work, and that the land is one of the most fertile portions in Malwa-Nimar region. Bharatiya Kisan Sangh’s Mahesh Chawdhary, the Prant Sangathan Mantri (Organisation Secretary) for the Malwa region said that they’ve proposed the Chhawani Anaaj-dalhan-tilhan Mandi as a viable site for the court premises to come up. According to BKS, the farmers and grain merchants who ply their trade in the mandi have repeatedly demanded that the mandi be moved out from the area as they’re facing an acute shortage of buyers. Constructing the court at the site of the mandi while simultaneously relocating the farmers to sell their grain produce at a site more fetching of customers would be a win-win situation for the government and the buyers, said Chawdhary – a proposal they’ve placed before the government in the form of a memo. The organization plans to stage a 3-4 hour long dharna on 7th June, expecting a couple thousand farmers and student activists to show up. Chawdhary said that they would seek Central University status for College of Agriculture, Indore among other demands, in a fresh memo they plan to bring out on the day of the protest. The Agriculture College has 59 hectare of land of which 20 acres has been approved for the court complex. This 20 acres has been in use for agriculture research work.

The Urladani Gram Sabha has passed a resolution to allot titles of rights over forest land to the residents under the Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006 and has placed it before the District Administration.

Village residents say the land is being used by them for habitation and cultivation and is part of the land on which they have filed claims under the FRA.

After securing bail, the tribals met the Superintendent of Police of Kalahandi and requested to established the CRPF camp at an alternate site, a 68-Acres of Govt Land lying near the village. Dubuli Majhi also filed a petition in the High Court of Odisha and (WP no-20835/2016) against the construction of the camp. The court stayed the construction. However the police rushed to the village and tried to vacate the land by removing families, including that of Dubuli Majhi. Village residents allege the police also beat up Majhi's wife Manojini.

The construction of the six-lane flyover began on June 9 in 2016 and has since been redesigned as a combination of elevated and surface project after earlier designs were shelved by the NHAI following protests from some area residents. The project includes a 10.185-km stretch, including a 3.2-km elevated corridor and three vehicular underpasses. A total of 607 structures, including houses and shops, in nine villages located along the Balongi-Kharar highway, will be bulldozed.

According to one stakeholder, people have deposited more than 800 crore. There are three aspects to this case. First, the builder sold the project without proper approvals and collected the money, though the developer had the approval of only for 790 plots, the company sold the flats and shops without proper zoning and building plans for it. Second, the farmers sold the land to the developer while the acquisition process for land was still on. Third, the Haryana government has now ordered a CBI probe into the matter. The farmers lost their case in Punjab & Haryana high court and according to stakeholders, they are also expected to lose the case in supreme court in light of Noida extension judgement. Despite the matter being sub-judice, the Haryana government ordered a CBI inquiry which was a political decision. No action has been taken against the farmers for selling off their land when the acquisition process was still on. Due to multiple claims and counter claims on the land and various litigations, the unitholders have been demanding that the 104-acre land is handed over to them under the supervision of the department of town and country planning. the alternative, they demanded that the allottees be given alternate units in other projects. their demands are due to their paying more than the value of the land along with the external development charges.",

The forest department has now fenced the land to restrict access and has prohibited cultivation. In addition, the department officials had reportedly threatened the village residents against accessing or cultivating on the land.

As population grew, traffic became a contstant problem on Gopalpura road. In September 2016, Jaipur Development Authority ( JDA) served notice to 338 shopkeepers around Gopalpura road to vacate their shops as they will be demolished. Shopkeepers protested and demanded compensation. The matter was shelved for a while. But recently due to rising traffic woes, JDA has decided to demolish these shops to widen the road from 80 feet to 160 feet. JDA Commissioner Vaibhav Galaria told LCW researcher that these shops were built on the government land, and that these encroachments are causing traffic issues. He said that demand of compensation is unjustified as the encroachments engage in commercial activities. However, Gopalpura Bypass Vyapar Mandal President Govind Agarwal said that they have their shops from more than two decades. People should be compensated and that they will continue to protest.",

The project is estimated to cost more than Rs 1989 crore. It is reported that the project was approved by the Forest Advisory Committee without considering any of the changes sought by environmentalists, such as reducing the height of a proposed dam. The project comprises a 231-kilometre (144 miles) long canal between the two rivers as well as two reservoirs. This requires felling more than 1.8 million trees, and most of the 6,400 hectares of forest land in and around Panna Tiger Reserve will be submerged. The project will also submerge nearly 2250 hectares of non-forest land and about 900 families, according to a feasibility report by the National Water Development Authority (NWDA). The protestors include those who depend on the forest land to earn livelihood, farmers, and those employed by the tourism industry in the Panna Tiger Reserve.

Last year, Rajasthan government began the process to rejuvenate the river. To widen the river, the government acquired about 200 bights of land from 60 families in Goner area. But the families are yet to be compensated. Ashok Mehta, general secretary of Dravyavati Nadi Prabhavit Kisaan Sangarah Samiti, said that they had moved to Jaipur Development Authority's or JDA's Tribunal Court against construction work initiated by JDA but the work is still ongoing. They had protested on June 3, 2017 at JDA Office but could not get satisfactory answer. Mehta said that the affected families should be given compensation as per the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. When the researcher approached Vaibhav Galaria, commissioner of Jaipur Development Authority (JDA), he said that a delegation had come to meet him regarding the compensation issue, and that he was looking into the matter.",

    "summary":"Residents of Amdai, a settlement on the outskirts of Sanguem town in South Goa, are opposing a large brewery and distillery factory proposed in their area. The factory is promoted by Vani Agro Farms, a New Delhi-based company that has permission to produce up to 5 crore liters of beer per year, besides other spirits. The project is being opposed since 2016 when the locals learned about it. The project is located near the Uguem River, which is a lifeline for Amdai as well as the settlements of Uguem village downstream of the proposed factory. The village residents feel that the factory's massive water requirement of five lakh liters per day will dry up the river and their water sources. Although the company has clarified that they would use water from the nearby Salauli Dam, locals are not convinced. They claim they have received some documents using the Right To Information Act, which shows that the brewery has permissions from the government to draw water from the river. Locals are also agitated that the factory is coming up on a coconut orchard, and entails cutting nearly 500 coconut trees. Residents allege that Goa’s infamous 2015 amendment to the Goa, Daman & Diu Preservation of Trees Act, 1984, that removed coconut from the list of protected trees was done specifically to favor this brewery. The amendment was openly supported by the then MLA of Sanguem Subhash Phaldesai of the ruling BJP government. In response to various news reports, Vani Agro has denied any connection with the coconut amendment but has admitted that because of it, they do not require any permissions for cutting the coconut palms. Village residents are also angry that the Goa state government declared the factory land as an ‘Investment Promotion Area’ under the Goa Investment Promotion Act, 2014, which takes away the local panchayat’s powers to veto the project. Residents also say that that being a “red category” industry, a brewery cannot come upon orchard land as per Goa’s zoning laws. The villagers along with the NGO Goa Foundation filed a writ petition before the Bombay High Court at Goa seeking the project's clearance by the IPB to be canceled as it is a 'Red' category industry. The petition also challenges the Town and Country Planning department's decision to convert the land use from 'Orchard' to 'Industry'. The petition is being heard. Meanwhile, in June 2017, the coalition government in Goa agreed to reverse the coconut tree amendment and also review all decisions given by the Investment Promotion Board.",

Residents of Bakhai filed an application to get community forestry rights on the forest near their village in December 2016 under Forest Rights Act. Sometime after that forest officials started to cut teak trees in the region where the community had asked for forest rights. When the residents questioned the forest department about the reason for cutting trees and that too without the Gram Sabha’s permission, considering that the village lies in the area covered under the Panchayats Extension to Scheduled Areas (PESA) Act, the forest officials didn't give any clear answer. Residents filed an application under the Right to Information Act asking under which notification forest is being cleared and whether the Gram Sabha’s permission has been sought or not. Gram Sabha's consent is mandatory before carrying out such work in areas covered under PESA. The Forest Department replied that no official notification has been issued for tree felling in the Bakhai Village forest land and later suspended two lower officials. About 20,000 teak trees were chopped in one week’s time. The residents depend on the forest land for livelihood. The villagers have written about this case with all the evidences to the district administration, tribal department, forest department, Chhattisgarh governor and even to the Prime Ministers Office. The Governor replied with assurance of investigation and action. The wood is still lying in the forest. Community Forestry Rights of the residents have still not been recognized.",

Forest villages were established in the pre-Independence era by the forest department as colonies of laborers for forestry projects. These villages have not been recognized in revenue records and their residents are deprived of benefits of the welfare schemes routed through the revenue department. Malsadra village is a forest village with a small population of 9 households under the Phulbani block of Kandhamal district. Gram Sabha members of Malsadra village have filed claims for conversion into revenue villages as well as for their community forest rights under the FRA in July 2015. The claims have been submitted to the Sub-Division Level Committee for the decision. However, even before the claims could be decided and titles of rights could be distributed, the forest department cut about 30 big trees of Sal and Teak in March 2016. The previous year, another 90-100 trees were felled by the department. The forest department says tree falling is part of the process prescribed in the working plan. The village residents, however, have been protesting against the tree felling. They claim the forest department's working plan would no longer be applicable on their community forest as their claims under the FRA are pending. Gramsabha of Malsadra village have filed a petition under Sec (7) of FRA and submitted to Chief Secretary Odisha demanding a ban on tree felling from their CFR area and on the interference by the forest department for any kind of working plan activity till their FRA claims are pending. After several instances of protests by the Gram Sabha, the forest department has taken out all the trees from the village. The claim of conversion of forest village into revenue village is pending with the District Level Committee formed under the FRA.",

The village residents have filed a claim of Community Forest Rights over 100 ha of forest land under the Forest Rights Act (FRA) in October 2016. The claims are still pending. Soon after the claim was filed, the forest department started the plantation in the area claimed by village residents for community forest rights. Within two months, the whole 100 ha area was fenced off by the forest department. The plantation was done under the Central Government's Compensatory Afforestation Scheme that allows the forest department to use the fund collected for plantation from the industries that use forestland for non-forest purpose. Due to the fencing, the community members are unable to enter the forest that has traditionally been used by them. The village residents claim this is a violation of their rights under FRA. They also allege that people in the village have been deprived of their basic livelihood options. Within the fenced area, there are 1 lakh Mahua trees on which all the households traditionally depended for earning. The plantation also stopped access to the community to their cremation ground and the grazing land. A focused group discussion with women, organized by Bhubneshwar-based nonprofit Vasundhara, revealed that due to fencing, the women were unable to collect Mahua and other medicinal plants which have resulted in the reduction of their yearly income. Gram Sabha members have filed a petition to the state tribal welfare department in January 2017 and demanded two things: a. Recognition of their Community Forest Rights as per their claims and b. No fencing and no commercial species plantation in that land. The tribal welfare department has issued a letter to the district collector following which an inquiry report on the matter has been submitted to the department.",

The roads that are getting built as a part of Smart City projects are called 'smart roads' because they are likely to have facilities like cycle tracks. Some slums and houses that are coming in the way of the smart road will need to be demolished, and people rehabilitated. People living in these slums and houses have been protesting along with the local Congress party members. The road project is worth Rs 28 crore. While some slums are encroachments, residents of some houses say that they have documents to show that the land belongs to them. Municipal Corporation says that the land belongs to them. It is disputed whether the land is private or common. Some residents have gotten a stay from the state High Court against the demolition of their houses. People say that the government is going ahead with demolition of slums without any proper rehabilitation plan. Reportedly, about 115 houses will be demolished. A delegation of Congress leaders also submitted a memorandum to the chief minister of Bhopal. Recently, residents of Rustam Khan Ka Ahata locality along with Congress leaders staged a road blockade in protest of the inauguration of this road project.",

The conflict started when the Forest Department demarcated 50 hectares of forest land and made boundaries forcefully in their village forest land in June 2016. The Gram Sabha of Ostapanga unanimously condemned the arbitrary decisions of Forest Department and sent their resolution to the Forest Department. In spite of this, the Forest Department is planning to hand over part of the village forest land of Ostapanga to the members of Van Surakshya Samiti (VSS), formed under the government scheme of Joint Forest Management, in the neighboring village Madhepur. The Ostapanga villagers strongly protested the move of Forest Department and send their Gram Sabha Resolution held on 30 Jan 2017 to the Chief Secretary and other authorities of Odisha.

Adani power will acquire 2,120 acres of privately owned land in and around 10 villages in Godda, including Motia. According to the project report around 900 families in 10 villages would be directly affected by the project. The public hearing on March 5, 2017 was called to discuss environmental impact of the project on Motia and adjoining villages. Around 3800 people from the affected villages attended the meeting. After the hearing, local residents, apparently not happy with the land acquisition compensation and transparency over jobs to the displaced youths, resorted to violence. Deputy superintendent of police, Baban Singh and two other policemen were targeted by the villagers. Singh received serious injury on his face during stone pelting. Anil Turkey, Additional Commissioner, Godda says, Few villagers were angry over the compensation package for land acquisition. We have noted their grievances and have forwarded their complaint to the industry department and also to Adani Power. Villagers resorted to violence because of lack of clarity on the project's compensation package. Babulal Marandi, chief of Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM) has said that Adani project will spread pollution and disease in Godda while its benefit would be enjoyed by Bangladesh. An email was sent to the public-relations team of Adani Power seeking its comment on the protest, which has not been answered yet. Protest against the Adanis have been on for over a year. After the violence on March 5, JVM staged a protest in the village to support the demands of the villagers.",

    "summary":"A rail freight terminal has been proposed in Xelvona, a hamlet in South Goa, on over 50 acres of private land consisting of farms, orchards and forests. The terminal has been proposed by Sociedade de Fomento Industrial Pvt Ltd, one of Goa’s largest mining firms, to handle 2 million tonnes per annum, each of iron ore and coal, besides smaller amounts of limestone and cement. The land is situated by the Zuari river, a navigable river that links interior Goa with the Mormugao Port. The terminal would integrate a jetty and a railway line. Imported coal and iron ore brought from the port by barges would be loaded onto rail wagons. Ore mined in Goa, for export, would be loaded at the jetty on barges heading to the port. The villagers, led by the Village Panchayat of Assolda, Xelvona, Xic-Xelvona and Hoddar, have opposed the project, arguing that the activity would severely pollute land and water sources, including the river Kushawati - the project is in its catchment area. While the land is privately held (Fomento is making direct purchases), the villagers contend that coal and ore dust would affect nearby agricultural land. Xelvona has a population of 3000, and all of them use land and water resources. The project received environment clearance from the Goa State Environment Impact Assessment Authority in December 2015. The Assolda panchayat called a special gram sabha in January 2016, which resolved to oppose the project. The panchayat then appealed to the Goa State Environment Impact Assessment Authority to revoke its clearance. In response, the authority kept its clearance in abeyance and issued a show-cause notice to Fomento. The show-cause hearings have been in progress since then. The villagers have staged numerous protests in state capital Panaji and at the project site. While 80% of the land has been purchased by Fomento, the panchayat is urging the remaining land owners to not sell the land. The panchayat has also alleges that land was forcibly acquired from farmers for widening of the approach road to the village, which is required for the terminal to operate.",

    "summary":"This conflict began in 2016 after the declaration of Pune International airport in Purandar Taluka under Pune district. The Maharashtra government had recently given permission to go ahead for carrying out a detailed project report (DRP) for the international airport under Pune district. About 2,400 hectares needs to be acquired for the airport. The site has been already approved by the Airports Authority of India (AAI). However,residents of affected villages Rajewadi, Amble, Waghapur, Pargaon Memane, Khanawadi, Munjawadi and Ikhatpur had passed resolutions that they would not give away their land to the project. The farmers in these villages are against the project. On December 26, 2016, thousands of villagers from six villages in Purandar blocked the Pune-Pandharpur Road for nearly two hours. It was said that the airport needed 2,400 hectare of land and this would affect 1,660 houses. residents of the affected villages say that farming is their main occupation to earn livelihood and that no amount of compensation can take care of that. The villagers also pointed out that Khanawadi houses the memorial of Mahatma Phule and this would be affected due to the upcoming airport. Initially, Chakan was fixed for the international airport in Pune city. But due to opposition from local farmers and the mountainous terrain, the government decided to set the new airport in Purandhar taluka as it was a flatter region compared to Chakan. Although Lohegaon air force station serves as an international airport in Pune city, only two to four international flights can operate from the airport. Moreover it is an Air Force base and has a single civil terminal which operates both international as well as domestic traffic.",

The mine is located in a reserve forest. People of the region have been facing several problems, ever since iron ore mining has begun there. These include, polluted water from mines entering and destroying paddy fields in villages. Farmers have not been compensated for this loss, and loss of livelihood from forest produce. The project affected people have also not got employment which was promised by the company. Reportedly, allegations have been made that the company has been employing people from outside which is a loss of opportunity for the locally affected people. Various other promises of the company related to infrastructure development, afforestation, education and health services etc. were also not fulfilled. Residents of the affected villages have sent memorandums raising these concerns to the district collector office. People demand that all the promises made by the company in the past should be fulfilled including compensation for their loss of livelihood. In December 2016, it was also reported that the contractor of the company allegedly cheated two adivasi farmers and transferred their land without giving them fair compensation. This matter is being investigated. It has also been reported from time to time that the mine has been under attack from Naxalites. In the year 2015, 30 vehicles used for mining operations were burnt by Naxalites. Once again in March 2017, it was reported that using pamphlets and banners, Naxalites threatened the workers and called for shut down of the mine.",

The port, to be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 21000 crores, aims to tap into the sea traffic between Europe and Asia and is part of the 'Sagarmala' Plan to have a string of ports across the country. Earlier the port was to be built at Colachel, some 10 km from Enayam, but after protests from the local community, it was moved to Enayam. Reports indicate that land survey is underway (both patta and poromboke i.e. government land is expected to be taken by the port). Local fishing communities are concerned as to the impact of the port on their livelihood. While some of the community members are protesting the port, others are supporting it as they feel it will bring employment. Those opposing the project also point out that hardly 20 km away, the Centre is developing another port at Vizhinjam in Kerala. Over 1,000 residents from seven revenue villages, a majority of them inland fishermen, under Midalam and Keezhkulam panchayats in Kanniyakumari district, staged a hunger strike in Thozhicode junction near Enayam in September last year.",

The company intends to expand the capacity of the power plant in coming years. They plan to build a railway siding from the Robertson railway station to the plant site, which is a route of approximately 15 kms, to transport coal. In June 2016, a public hearing for the railway line project was organized at the Kunkuni village of the Kharsiya block, one of the villages through which the railway line is expected to pass. The villagers were not adequately informed about the public hearing in advance and the posters were put up temporarily, allegedly, only to be photographed by the company officials for documentation purposes. Few villagers who attended the hearing were not allowed to express their protest against the project. The company has also illegally bought some land through various middlemen in the region at throwaway prices from tribes people. On 5th January 2017, a second round of public hearing was conducted but villagers were not informed about it in advance. They learnt about it when they saw the preparations taking place for the event in a school premises. In this particular hearing, many villagers were not allowed to participate. Neither the Panchayat members nor social activists were allowed. The villagers presented a petition to the Sub Divisional Magistrate demanding cancellation of this public hearing. The community, largely tribes people, is against the project because the company fraudulently got their land records transferred in the names of their employees at throwaway prices. As a result, whatever compensation the company will formally offer will go to these new and dubious owners of land rather than the original adivasi owners.",

    "summary":"In May 2016, the Union government announced a new Indian Institute of Technology in Goa. Classes for the 2016-17 session began from a temporary campus, while a 300-acre permanent campus was proposed at Loliem village in Loliem-Pollem panchayat, South Goa district, Goa. A committee formed by the Human Resource Development Ministry selected the site. The state government will acquired the land and handover to IIT Goa. The residents of Loliem are opposing the campus. The site falls on an uninhabited laterite plateau, which is partly covered by a forest and the rest is used for monsoon cultivation, cashew plantations, grazing and as an important sacred site. The settlements of Loliem are on the slopes of the periphery plateau which is also a principal source of water for Loliem. The porous laterite absorbs rainwater, lets it out in springs and recharges aquifers. Residents of Loliem have come together under a banner of Citizens Committee of Loliem to oppose the IIT saying it threatens their water and livelihood security, and their cultural rights. They also want to preserve the forested parts of the plateau, which are contiguous with Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary and Anshi Tiger Reserve. They report the occurrence of Schedule I species like Leopards, Bisons, Pangolins (confirmed by me through photographs) and floral biodiversity in the area. Both Madhav Gadgil and K Kasturirangan Committees on Western Ghats had recommended the plateau to be notified as an eco-sensitive zone. However, the land falls under Comunidade of Loliem - a system dating back to the Portuguese where a committee of native inhabitants of the village collectively own land and decide how it is put to use. The members also share the generated revenue, if any. The Comunidade gave its consent to transfer the land to the state government for setting up the IIT in February 2016. In the same month, the Government of Goa moved an amendment to the Goa Legislative Diploma No. 2070, which consists of rules of Comunidades, to allow Comunidade to grant land to the state government for premier educational institutes of national importance without auction. This amendment has enabled the government to get possession of the land. But the residents of the village are opposing the project and have sent letters to the HRD ministry and the state government asking to change the site of IIT. In October 2016, the villagers managed to pass a Gram Sabha resolution banning any non-traditional use of the plateau land. In November 2016, a special gram sabha was called under heavy police presence to take a vote on IIT. Although about 2000 people gathered to participate, the sabha was abruptly adjourned by the Sarpanch, who is in favour of the project. The village sarpanch is a member of the Comunidade. A commotion followed the adjournment and several villagers tried blockading the Sarpanch’s vehicle from leaving the premises. The Sarpanch later filed a police complaint against eight villagers on charges of rioting, wrongful restraint and assault. The investigation is on. Meanwhile, with state elections due in February 2017, the land is yet to be granted to the state government.",

    "summary":"Following the attack on Dalit community by cow vigilantes in Una village of Gujarat's Gir Somnath district, Dalits have been demanding land to be able to live with dignity. Successive governments have ignored the issue of land distribution to all Dalits. A governors’ committee set up by India’s only Dalit president, K.R. Narayanan, reported that there is enough government land for distribution to every landless rural family that belongs to Scheduled Caste. In Una, of the 57 Dalit families, only three have got a patch of land. Most Dalits here are daily agricultural wage labourers and a few skin carcasses of dead animals. District collector says that at least 2 acre can be allocated to each family, but none have got possession yet. In nearby Junagadh district, three Dalit men who had been demanding land titles consumed poison and one of them died.",

    "summary":"In the wee hours of December 10, 2016, a team of nearly 100 forest officials arrived in the Juria settlement of Baghetapu Char (riverbank area) and started demolishing houses while the villagers were still asleep, reported local Assamese newspapers. At least nine houses were demolished by elephants and another eight were set on fire. The forest guards allegedly assaulted villagers, including women and elderly. A pregnant women was also reportedly injured. Around 80 families have been living in Baghetapu village for the past 30-40 years. The village is located at the border area of Nagaon and Sonitpur districts, on the bank of river Brahmaputra. The residents are the erosion-affected people who settled here after being displaced by floods. Most of them are landless as their land has been eroded by the Brahmaputra. On 19 October 2016, Nagaon district administration an issued eviction notice, asking the residents to vacate the land within stipulated time. Under the banner of All Assam Sangkhalogu Sangram Parishad, a local civil society organisation, the villagers demonstrated in front of the office of the deputy commissioner of Nagaon and demanded rehabilitation and resettlement before eviction. The representative of deputy commissioner assured the villagers that the administration will find a way out after discussing with the stakeholders. However, on 19 November, one of the villagers got another eviction notice. On 10 December 2016, the eviction order was executed by the forest department. The residents alleged that the eviction drive was illegally carried out in the absence of executive magistrate from civil administration department as well as anyone from the police department. Around 10,000 people assembled and protested against the demolition and eviction drive. Seeing people gathering in large numbers, the eviction team left the place soon. Residents reportedly informed the administration that they were ready to move out from forestland once they were provided rehabilitation as they had lost their land in erosion. Many of the villagers possessed Erosion Certificate issued by revenue departments. Though, of the 80 households, 17 were demolished during the eviction drive, no one has moved out of the village so far. But there is fear that the government will launch another eviction operation again.",

The environment ministry gave clearance for increasing the production capacity from 35 Metric Tonne Per Annum (MTPA) to 41 MTPA in the Gevra mine in 2015. On May 2, 2016, Korba witnessed a massive protest against land acquisition for mining by the South Eastern Coal Fields (SECL) which is a subsidiary of Coal India Limited (CIL). Around 679 people from 41 villages protested at the site of the Gevra Mine. These villagers were all farmers who demanded jobs, rehabilitation and compensation as per the amended Land Acquisition Act. Various provisions in laws such as the CBA Act, 1957; PESA Act, 1996 and Forest Rights Act, 2006 have been violated for land acquisition in the region. Employment for the members of the displaced families has become an important issue in the region. The problem is worsening because the production process is becoming more capital intensive and mechanized which has led to a reduction in the number of available jobs. The High Court of Chhattisgarh has also ruled in the favour of various project affected persons ordering SECL to provide jobs to the affected people. The company is offering one job for every two acre of the acquired land, and livelihood package of Rs. 5 lakh to those families whose acquired land was less than two acres and so cannot be given jobs. Unsatisfied farmers are demanding better livelihood package and jobs for all adult members of the family. There are plans to further increase the production capacity upto 70 MTPA.",

It is state highway that was recently converted into a national highway. It is one of the busiest roads in Karnataka. The highway was four-laned about 15 years ago. Now six more lanes are to be added. Yet another project—the NICE-promoted 110-km Bengaluru-Mysuru Express Corridor—has been hanging in the air for two decades.

People complain that the public hearing was farcical and residents were not involved in it. They were not given prior information about it, and the venue was too far from the village, they say. They have demanded cancellation of the ongoing public hearings. Additional Collector Vipin Manjhi from Kanker has agreed to it, but the Chhattisgarh Environment Conservation Board website states that the public hearings were successfully completed. The people have seen the impact of mining on communities nearby who have given in to such projects. They have raised concerns such as loss of forests and biodiversity, pollution of water sources and degradation of soil and environment.",

    "summary":"The Green Pharma City project, planned on the outskirts of the capital city of Hyderabad, will be spread over 15,000 acres (6,070 ha) in Ranga Reddy district and a part of Mahbubnagar district. About 400 companies are expected to set up their units in the pharma hub with an initial investment of around Rs17,000 crore. Apart from bulk drug manufacturing companies, there is a proposal to set up a pharma university as a part of the project. Farmers in eight villages would lose their landholdings for the project. The villages where land is being acquired include Kurmidda, Tadiparthy, Nanaknagar and Medpally in Yacharam mandal, and Mucherla, Meerkhanpet, Aakulamylaram and Shaireddyguda in Kandukur mandal. Of the total land proposed for the project, around 6,000 acres (2,428 ha) is forestland. The Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation and the other departments concerned started land acquisition for the project in 2016. As the first step, government land is being fenced. In the first phase of land acquisition, farmers in villages like Kandukur and Yacharam have received notices for land acquisition under Government Order (GO) No.123 and GO 45. Farmers in Mucherla, Meerkhanpet and several other villages are resisting acquisition of their lands, alleging the authorities have not followed the due process under the Land Acquisition Act of 2013. Farmers have also challenged the government for promising compensation of only Rs 7.5 to 8.5 lakh per acre (0.4 ha) against the market rate of Rs 45 lakh to Rs 60 lakh per acre. In response to a petition by eight farmers cultivating government assigned lands from Kurmidda village, the state high court stayed the land acquisition. Local activists say the authorities are, however, going ahead with land acquisition in violation of court orders by resorting to threats and spreading misinformation. The agitating farmers have joined hands under the banner of Pharma City Bhu Nirvasitula Committee. They allege that no detailed project report or environmental impact assessment report related have been placed before the public for discussion. Local people also fear forced displacement as a result of air and water pollution from the drug industries once they become operational.",

The route will curve through six states in the north and west of the country. On either side of the corridor, a few kilometres will be acquired for industrialisation and urbanisation. People who will be affected by the acquisition have expressed their discontentment. In Dholera, Gujarat, farmers have objected to land pooling for a 920-sq km special investment region. With economic growth, the cost of this planned project is also expected to escalate. The landowners can retain half of their land, but will be resettled, as per the new planning rules. Last year, the Gujarat High Court stayed land acquisition for the project.",

    "summary":"A resolution was passed in the Gram Sabha in May that the villagers are in opposition to this land acquisition by the MIDC. Earlier, agricultural lands from Navlakh Umbre, Bhadalwadi, Paritwadi, Jadhavwadi and Mindewadi have been given for MIDC and Jadhavwadi dam. Yet, the government is keen on acquiring such lands. The villagers did not let the officials complete the measurement of land and sent them back. Sarpanch Nagesh Shirke with few others from the village have lead the protest while many of the local leaders have also shown support to the farmers. The land to be acquired is an irrigated land. The area already has 57 wells, settlements and cattlesheds of about 175 and 6 poultry farms. Also 160 farmers use the water from Jadhavwadi dam for irrigation (approved licence for irrigating 350 acres of land). The attached Government resolution mentions that if the land is under irrigation and farmers protest against it, it is not to be acquired. Currently, post negotiation, the rate for acquisition reached as high as Rs 55 lakh for an acre of land — one of the highest in the region. Owing to the present rate of the compensation offered, almost 80 per cent of the villagers whose land were acquired have managed to earn huge amount of money. Records show that till now 287 hectare of land have been acquired and the total disbursement made towards the acquisition is Rs 331 crore. The total budget allocated for the acquisition is Rs 525 crore. The process of acquisition saw land covered on 1,343 land records in Badalwadi, 1,098 land records in Mendewadi and 104 land records in Navlakh Umbre being acquired. 288 villagers of Badalwadi have accepted the compensation, 373 have accepted the same in Mendewadi and eight people have accepted the compensation at Navlakha Umbre. The Sarpanch however mentioned that many villagers had to part with smaller land parcels and those who got compensation had invested in the land.",

In 2011, MMRDA proposed to extend the Metro Line. The car shed was proposed on 30 hectares. Following protests, it was scaled down to 20.82 hectares. Now the government is seeking 62 hectares for the purpose. After the Ministry of Environment and Forests declared Aarey Colony an eco-sensitive zone (ESZ), the state government is considering a private plot at Royal Palms for the car shed, said the managing director of MMRC.

Three days after the talks, another batch of some 70 Dalit families grabbed the same piece of land. They, too, started constructing huts there and brought in their cattle. A police complaint was filed to remove the land grabbers. A contingent of police tried to get the land vacated but stiff protest by Dalit families forced it to retreat. The police action angered the Dalit families and they protested outside the Manika police station. They demanded immediate suspension of police officers who tried to evict them without giving notice. Police registered a FIR against the village head of Manika Bishunpur along with 100 unnamed protestors. In their counter complaint, the Dalit families have claimed that they have not grabbed land. They said the former minister was not using the fertile land for decades and they were only trying to eke out a living from it.

In 2012, villagers of Hadiyol near Himmatnagar in Sabarkantha district protested against the state government for taking back 27 acres of land from the village panchayat to set up a medical college. The district revenue department had given this gauchar (pastoral) land to the panchayat in 1983-84 for residential purpose for Hadiyol. In 2007,32 dalit families applied for plots and were allocated the same with a condition that they have to complete construction within two years. However,in December 2011,the government took back the entire piece of land for breaching these conditions. The same land was subsequently allotted for the construction of a government medical college. In the same district, villagers from Harsol village had filed a PIL in the Gujarat High Court challenging allotment of 40 hectares of grazing land to industries by the state government. All such encroachments have led to the situation that has arisen now. In the current session's written reply to the Assembly, the state panchayats and rural development minister accepted that 4,725 hectares of gauchar land in 33 districts has been encroached upon. The government also conceded that 57.54 hectares of gauchar land in the Gir sanctuary was encroached upon before 1987-88 and these encroachments have still not been removed.",

Now,the members of Adivasi Mulwasi Bachao Manch of Sundergarh District led by Biramitrapur MLA George Tirkey stood strongly against the move by saying that,the RSP had illegaly acquired the land several decades ago and surrendered the same.

But without the permission and information to the Gram Sabha, the area of 109 ha claimed under CFR was fenced by the forest department in the same year using CAMPA fund. This fencing was done immediately after the CFR titles were claimed by the villagers. Villagers allege that it was done with an intention to show their CFR land as an area under reserved forest by fencing and extending the boundaries of the forest so that the CFR can be rejected. When villagers raised their concerns at the range office. The forest department agreed to keep a gate for accessibility in the fenced area. People are not satisfied with the solution. Becuase it is a huge area and gate would be accessible for only fewer people. Village residents say that they will get the fencing removed as soon as they get their CFR titles. Not only this, in a nearby village Arjuni, the crematory ground i.e. the Samshan land -- which was given under section-3(2) of the FRA -- has been fenced by the Forest department and now with no accessibility, the village residents must go to the riverside for performing the crematory rituals. They have raised this issue (loss of cultural crematory land) to the district collector too and every time there is a Gram Suraaj program i.e. a state level grievance redressal session they raise these issues.",

The claim is currently pending with the sub-divisional level committee. Though few village residents have been granted their Individual Forest Rights but, they are still waiting for clarity over location and demarcations of their lands. Meanwhile, the forest department has planted on the land over which the Gram Sabha had claimed for Community Forest Rights in 2009. The afforestation programmes have been taken under MGNREGA and CAMPA funds. The Gram Sabha members are now demanding for clarification over ambiguous demarcations of plots already recognised under Individual Forest Rights and a prohibition on the plantation of commercial species on village’s agricultural land. The Gram Sabha members strongly believe in the virtues of communitarian lifestyle which they assert will receive a positive impetus from the recognition of Community Forest Resource Rights. Therefore, they continue to reach out to the District Administration for verification of their Community Forest Rights over the claimed land. According to rule 4(1)(e) provided in Forest Rights Act, the Gram Sabha members can constitute a CFR Management Committee post the recognition of the rights as well as while the application is under verification. The Gram Sabha members of Masinnita village, thus, decided on constituting a CFR management Committee and prepare a CFR Management Plan of their own, while continuing to press authorities for the verification of their rights and protest against any form of external intervention by forest department like in the case of CAMPA plantations.",

Families are accusing the company’s management of backtracking, and partially fulfilling the demands made in the agreement. Around 12 villages with a population of 1646 persons were displaced to pave way for the project. The joint venture acquired 565 acres of raiyati land for the project. The power plant has a capacity of 1050 MW of electricity. According to affected families, company management refuses to recognize and give them entitlement of permanent workers. They said that the agreement while negotiating the rehabilitation and resettlement package included jobs to 1646 displaced persons. The displaced employed by the company are demanding a copy of the agreement signed between displaced and company. They are also demanding appointment letter to displaced workers who have been employed for years by the company and a permanent gate pass to enter the company. This is not for the first time that displaced families and company management have locked horns over the unfulfilled demands. Last year, around 24 displaced workers went on indefinite hunger strike on a similar issue. Management had to bow to the demands, after health of two workers deteriorated leading to hospitalization. Workers have warned that they will soon intensify the agitation if their demands are not met. Efforts to contact Tata Power, DVC and district administration failed despite repeated attempts.",

Protests have begun again, and residents of 13 villages came together under the banner of Wadhwan Bunder Virodhi Sangharsh Samiti. They organized a rally in Wadhwan against the port and stopped the survey team from surveying the area for the project. The Samiti has already approached the Dahanu Taluka Environment Protection Authority and has plans to approach the National Green Tribunal as well. The villagers allege that the construction of the port will reduce their area for fishing as well as fish availability. Residents are also apprehensive that a large port will also restrict the potential of the area to be developed for tourism. There is also a fear that the reclamation work could lead to flooding of homes close to the sea. The project is currently stalled as Dahanu is notified as an 'Eco-sensitive zone' and will need to be de-notified before the project proceeds.",

    "summary":"The Odisha government initiated the Rengali Dam project on the Mahanadi River in 1983. The dam was constructed to regulate the flow of the Mahanadi River, to deal with the floods and droughts in the region, and to produce hydroelectricity through several hydroelectric plants. Several families were displaced from Sambalpur and Dhenkanal districts to make space for the dam. Some of these families were relocated to Mahasindhu (B) village Riamal Block of the Deogarh district in 1985. Most of these families belonged to the Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) Pauri Bhuyan. They were dependent on the surrounding forests for their daily needs and food. They collected minor forest produce like like Mahua, Sal, Harida and other medicinal herbs and practiced shifting cultivation in the forests. However, in 2015-16, the forest department started fencing the forests and carried out plantation of commercial species like teak, acacia over 10 hectare of land used by these families. The Gramsabha members of Mahasindhu village have been protesting against this. They have filed a petition with the Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Caste Development Department, demanding recognition of their Community forest resource rights under the Forest Rights Act, 2006 and opposing the plantation of commercial species over the claimed land in October, 2016.",

    "summary":"Pendravan also known as Pt.Lakhan Lal Mishra Reservoir which was constructed during British time in 1909 is the main source of water and irrigation for about 14 villages in Tilda Tehsil of Raipur district. The reservoir is a nesting location for many migratory birds during winters and is located near Mohrenga Protected Forest and Khaulidabri Protected Forest. The reservoir came under threat of open cast limestone mining when mining lease was granted to Ultratech Cement in the year 2012 after the issuance of No Objection Certificate by the Water Resource Department. In the Public hearing on 18th August 2015 for environment clearance of the project, concerns on the decrease in the irrigation capacity of the reservoir due to mining were raised by the villagers and elected representatives of the region. But the government went ahead and granted Environment clearance to the project in 2015. After which Water Resource Department issued another No-Objection-Certificate in January 2017 for carrying out the mining project located 50 metres from the water body i.e. Pendravan dam. The NOC by the water resource department said that the reservoir adjoining the mine would not be affected by the mining activities. The Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) report mentions that mining will be fully mechanised open cast mining with the use of detonators and deep hole blasting. Activists say that this activity can damage the walls of the dam and cause seepage and hence loss of water from the dam. Also, EIA report does not mention how the reservoir will be protected from the impacts of mining in the EIA report. Following these events farmers of the 14 villages came together for opposing this project. According to EIA, a total of 689 hectare of land area has been given on lease. Of this 658.451 is private land. No acquisition has begun yet. Farmers formed a samiti named Pendravan Bachao Sangharsh Samiti demanding cancellation of NoC issued by Water Resource department. In this movement not only the farmers but the local politician and MLA of the region also played a major role to draw attention of the government towards the issue. Protest in Raipur, human chain formation near the water body, drawing media’s attention and raising questions on the NoC in the state legislative assembly were the part of the movement. Finally after months of struggle, the state government cancelled the NoC issued for the project on 3rd March 2017. Although the conflict was mitigated at political level but the legal battle is still going on as the Ultratech Cement has taken this matter to the High Court.",

    "summary":"Residents of Navelim village, a panchayat area on the outskirts of Margao town in South Goa, have been protesting against a proposed highway called “western bypass”. It is said to be a bypass for National Highway-66, and is proposed by the Union ministry of highways and executed by the Goa state public works department. Nearly 4.5 lakh square meters of land have been acquired since 2003. The acquisition has taken place under the old land acquisition act of 1894 by invoking the infamous ‘urgency clause’. The proposal has been criticised for bulldozing over wetlands, paddy fields, and green areas. Locals are afraid that construction over wetlands will raise the risk of floods. Nearly half of the land acquired is under active paddy cultivation, while nearly 1400 trees are to be cut, for which the state forest department has given its clearance. People have written to the state government and also done several demonstrations at the site, where work is in progress. In May 2016, the BJP-led state government promised to build the bypass on stilts so that wetlands are not disturbed. But this failed to placate the villagers - in any case, there was no official change in the construction plans. In August 2016, a gram sabha of the Navelim panchayat passed a unanimous resolution demanding the bypass project be scrapped. With no resolution in sight, some locals have threatened to move to the National Green Tribunal. They have also alleged that road construction is progressing in areas outside those acquired. In March 2017, they even blocked the road to stop dumpers that were carrying construction material.",

    "summary":"The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is exploring the possibilities of extracting shale gas from the Krishna Godavari Delta.This region is considered as the rice bowl of South India, is facing major ecological challenges, which may threaten its very survival. It has chosen five sites in the region for setting up exploratory wells. While three of them are in West and East Godavari districts, the rest lie in Krishna District. This comes at a time when the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has come up with a policy brief about Shale Gas, in a bid to meet the supply – demand gap of energy and thereby avert an ‘impending crisis’.7 acres of land is taken for lease by ONGC in 2015 paying 53000 per acre per year. The construction started in April 2015 while the public hearing was held in November 2016 and it is yet to get clearance from MoEF. This discrepancy has been challenged in the court. The villagers say that, this is three time crop and they are fearing the pollution of their ecology as well as their lands and water, as fracking involves sending lakhs of liters of water into the underground to break the rocks, which releases the trapped gas in them. Shale Gas extraction involves sending huge amount of water coupled with chemicals and sand to depths of up to 4000 meters under high pressure. This process is called Hydro Fracking or Fracking. The high pressure creates fissures in the rocks and releases the trapped shale gas from the rock formations. For Krishna Godavari Basin, which already has a recorded evidence of land subsidence due to the existing 65 hydrocarbon fields in the region, the exploration of shale gas is only making the environmental disaster even more acute. “Around 80 per cent of the mixture remains underground and the remaining 20 per cent rises to the surface which is not disposed off safely,” says retired professor and geologist Krishna Rao, who was part of field surveys and studies recording the land subsidence in the region. Environmentalists, including Rao, claim that many different chemical products, some of which are toxic, are injected, along with several million gallons of fresh water, into each of the wells. Fracking was first tried in the United States in the 1940’s. From being an importer of Liquid Natural Gas, United States is now self-sufficient and is even planning to export. However, this has come with a significant environmental cost. Experience from US has taught that the leakage of the toxic chemicals has contaminated aquifers, which are the sources of drinking water. Fracking has been banned by many countries in Europe and also by many states in the United States, owing to proven scientific studies and records of pollution of air, water and other community resources in the vicinity.",

    "summary":"Baina is a beach near Vasco-da-Gama, Goa, with a colony of approximately 400 houses owned by fishermen and migrant workers. However, these homes have been facing demolition threats since 2015 under various laws. In 2015, 205 houses were issued demolition notices under disaster management rules for being dangerously close to the sea, and some houses for encroaching upon church property. Authorities demolished around 60 houses during the monsoons, allegedly with no rehabilitation. Families were moved to a nearby sports centre, and evicted from there after a month. The remaining residents got a stay order from the High Court of Bombay at Goa. In 2016, the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) issued demolition orders to 121 houses for falling within the ‘No Development Zone’ i.e. within 200 metres of the High Tide Line. The fishermen challenged this because the Coastal Regulatory Zone Notification, 2011, under which the demolition was ordered, exempts structures built before 1991. Asserting their right to live there as the notification strives to protect livelihoods of traditional coastal communities, they claimed to have lived there for at least 80 years. The then Portuguese colonial government allowed fishermen to live within 60 metres from the High Tide Line. However, they do not have documentary evidence to show that their homes existed before 1991. Electricity and water connections were issued to them only in 1993-94. In various cases before the High Courts, they have petitioned that personal hearings should be held. They also demand setting up of District Coastal Committees, which by law have fishermen representatives and can certify whether the houses existed before 1991. The High Court in September 2016 quashed the GCZMA demolition order and ordered personal hearings to take place. In a recent submission, the Goa government said that it will form the District Coastal Committees once the new elected government takes office in March 2017. Fishermen allege that disaster management and coastal zone rules are an excuse for the government’s long-drawn ‘beautification drive’ at Baina. In 2003, the government setup a garden and an auditorium, and now aims to clear the fishing settlements. The fishermen have been fighting against demolition drives in their personal capacity, and also under the umbrella of Baina Ramponkar & Fishing Canoe Owners Society and Goenchea Ramponkarancho Ekvott, a pan-Goan union of fishermen.",

    "summary":"National Mineral Development Corporation has been operating the Bailadila Iron Ore Mine for the last five decades. This particular conflict is over planned increase in the production from 4.2 Metric Tonne Per Annum (MTPA) to 6 MTPA in Deposit Number 10 of the mine. The environment clearance for the expansion is yet to be granted. The residents from about 20 villages in the region are protesting against the expansion because it will affect their crops and water bodies. Layers of dust settle on their agricultural land affecting its productivity, and polluting water bodies that people use. In the rainy season, a lot of iron ore particles flow into the agricultural fields with the various seasonal water streams and further cause damage to the crop. A lot of land in and around the Bailadia region has become barren. The entire land area for which mining lease has been given falls in the Bailadila Reserve Forest, under the category of the forest land. Village residents depend on it for their livelihood. A public hearing, to increase the production capacity in Deposit 10, scheduled for December 2015 was cancelled because the company did not follow the required procedures in disseminating prior information about it in the villages. Another public hearing was held in November 2016, again without properly informing residents of villages who protested by submitting a petition to the regional officer of the Chhattisgarh Environment Conservation Board. Residents of the affected villages say that if the government still goes ahead with the expansion, they want safe drinking water and jobs for every family.",

The Rs.2.7 crore-first phase grant was to acquire land for an approach road to the Thuravur-Thycauttussery Bridge, while the Rs.49.5 crore-NABARD-sponsored second phase was for the construction of the bridge. The third-phase plan was to spend Rs.6.89 crore for construction of the road from Pallithode State Highway to the Udayanapuram Junction on the Ernakulam-Ettumannoor State Highway. A sum of Rs.4.3 crore was set aside for land acquisition for this phase. The fourth phase in Plan was to have construction of the Makkekadavu-Nerekadavu Bridge, worth Rs.88.5 crore initially. The project was delayed as the authorities failed to begin land acquisition for Makkekadavu bridge. The total length of the bridge is 800 metre, and 720 metre of this bridge will be constructed across the Vembanad lake. The remaining 80 metre of the bridge can be constructed only after acquiring private land from Kottayam and Alappuzha districts. On May 27, 2015, the then chief minister Oommen Chandy opened the first bridge at Thykkattuserry and announced that the second bridge - Makkekadavu -would be opened in 2017. However, the land acquisition for the second bridge has not been started so far owing to strong opposition from landowners. While people in the both the towns see the project as an important developmental initiative that can shorten the travel distance to the state capital, the families whose land would be acquired either do not want to be displaced or demand higher compensations. The fisher folks in the region are against any big construction across the wetland they are depending on for livelihood. Affected families have formed an 'action council' to hold protests in the area.",

They have been cultivating tubers, fruit, millets and other indigenous crops on the land for the past several generations. The conflict started when the forest department carried out massive teak plantations on their cultivated land without any consent. The plantations are being carried out under schemes such as the Odisha Forestry Sector Development Project (externally aided project supported by Japan International Cooperation Agency), plantations for compensatory afforestation using Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) funds and plantations using Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act funds. In a gram sabha meeting in September 2015, the villagers passed a resolution against the plantations, resolving that the forced plantations will have adverse impact on the rights and livelihood of the forest dwellers and biodiversity. The villagers sent their grievances to various government authorities, including the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), following which the NHRC visited the area and submitted its report to the government. The report confirmed that the plantations were being carried out on the land on which tribal rights were recognized under FRA. The forest department, however, claimed the plantations were taken up with the help of Vana Samrakhshan Samity (a joint committee of forest department and village residents), after thorough discussion with the villagers and there was no case of forcible plantation. But villagers insist that this is a clear violation of their rights under FRA. Despite the protest by the villagers, the forest department is continuing the plantation.",

    "summary":"Rowmari, a village located 170 km from Assam’s capital city of Guwahati, is in the centre of a controversy following allotment of some 485 hectares of its land to Patanali Ayurved, managed by Baba Ramdev. The village is located in Chirang district of Bodoland Territorial Autonomous Districts (BTAD).The Bodoland Territorial Council which administers BTAD—home to plains tribes (mainly the Bodos)—has made the allotment for setting up a yogpith. BTAD falls under 6th Schedule of the Indian Constitution for administering tribal areas of four north-eastern states, including Assam. Violence, based on identity, ethnicity, language, religion and land has kept the region on the boil for the past few decades. BTC administration as well as Patanjali claim that the proposed yogpith will help create jobs for local people and explore the possibilities of promoting animal husbandry and medicinal plants in Assam. Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal is reported to have assured that under his “ease of doing business” plan, land will be swiftly handed over to Patanjali. Civil society organizations and affected residents who have been opposing the allotment since its announcement in 2015, say this is a clear case of illegal land grab in a Sixth Schedule area, where non-tribals from outside the region have no right to purchase land. The United Liberation Front of Assam or ULFA (I), a secessionist armed group which is fighting an armed battle with Indian state for Assam's independence, alleges that Ramdev wants the land to set up a “ factory of communal Aryan politics of the RSS here in the name of Patanjali Trust. A number of local organisations like All Bodo Students' Union, All BTC Minority Students' Union, Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti and All Assam Minority Students' Union are also opposing the land allotment. All Adivasi Student Association of Assam has threatened that until and unless displaced Adivasis are rehabilitated, such land transfers wouldn't be allowed. BTC administration has given a bizarre logic for the land allotment. The land is being allotted to Patanjali so that the same would not be encroached by illegal immigrants, BTC has said, according to news reports. Prodom Bodo of All Bodo Students' Union issued a press statement, saying the allotted area includes legally owned land of Bodos, Rajbongshis and some Muslims. In addition, some government-owned plots have been handed over. But no compensation has been paid to the land owners yet. In fact, many owners do not know that their land has been handed over, says Prodom. The advisor of Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti is in judicial custody for protesting the allotment. The ongoing agitation against the land allotment is expected to gain momentum in the near future.",

    "summary":"SIPCOT Industrial Growth Centre at Gangaikondan was set up on 2,033 acres of land in Tirunelveli district close to Tirunelveli–Madurai National Highway. Government of Tamil Nadu had given license to the multinational giant PEPSICO to setup a factory in Gangaikondan SIPCOT in Manur Panchayat union in about 36 acres of land. The company has entered in to an agreement with the government to use the water from Thamirabarani river for the purpose of soft drinks manufacturing. Pepsi proposed to draw around ten lakh litres a day from the Tamirabarani at 3.75 paise per litre for manufacturing beverages in its plant at Gangaikondan. A RTI filed by a local resident has revealed that the soft drink multinational giant has been given a license to use 15 lakh (1.5 million) litres of water every day from the river for the period of 99 years lease. Already another company the South India Bottling Company Private Limited (SIBCL) a franchisee of soft drinks giant Coca-Cola which was set up in 2006 with Rs. 280 million /US$ 6,500,000, is located in the same Gagaikondan SIPCOT and is taking 10 lakh (1 million) litres of water from Thamirabarani river at the rate of Rs 13.50 per 1,000 litre. This is a 7-acre factory unit with a 36 acre campus. River Thamirabarani starts in Pothigai hills and ends in Srivaikundam. This is the only perennial river of Tamilnadu. The river irrigates around 120 square kms of agricultural lands in Tirunelveli district and Tuticorin district. It is the only source of drinking water for the people of Tirunelveli district. The people of Tirunelveli consider the river as the mother of all and attach a spiritual importance to it. If there is no Tamirabarani, there is no agriculture in Tirunelveli and neighbouring districts. As a result local people and several groups have been protesting. Both PepsiCo and Coke, since their respective entries into India in 1990 and 1993, have invested about $2 billion here. PepsiCo India has 42 bottling plants in the country, while Coke has 58. India is expecting to receive $10.5 billion in investments from the two global giants by 2020.",

About 460 acres was alienated in Thotapalli village in Agiripalli mandal in favour of the Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (APIIC) for establishment of the Rs 150-crore food park. But the choice of the location triggered objections from various quarters, including members of the Andhra Chamber of Commerce and Industry Federation, who argued that the land was not suitable for the project as it was located on high altitude of above 100 feet and was covered by a hillock. The Union Food Processing Ministry had given its nod to the state government for setting up the project in April last year. The Centre has already allotted Rs. 50 crore grant-in-aid while the state government will have to mobilise Rs 150 crore for the project. The government says the food park will transform the lives of local farmers. Some of the farmers are demanding better compensation, while some of them are accepting the government's Rs 7 lakh compensation.",

Setting up such manufacturing hubs is a part of the National Manufacturing Policy (NMP) brought out in 2011 by the erstwhile Congress-led alliance government at the Centre to give a boost to the manufacturing sector and enhance its overall contribution to GDP. The total land proposed to be acquired for setting up the NIMZ in Medak is 12,636 acres (5,114 ha), spread across 17 villages in Nyalkal and Jharasangam mandals in the western part of the district. A large part of the land proposed to be acquired is privately owned. The government is seeking to buy these land parcels through negotiations with the land owners under Government Order (GO) 123. But this GO does not contain any provision for compensating the landless and other categories of people affected by alienation of government land (including commons) for the project. In April 2016, around 22 landless, dalit agricultural labourers (mostly women) filed a petition in the high court against the use of GO 123 for acquisition of land for the NIMZ, contending that the order violates the key provisions contained in the Land Acquisition Act of 2013, relating to payment of compensation and resettlement and rehabilitation of the landless and other affected households in the event of land acquisition. In response to this petition, the high court struck down GO 123 as unconstitutional and arbitrary. The government later managed to secure an interim stay on this order while promising to notify a revised GO with enhanced provisions for all the affected people.",

    "summary":"Surguja Power Private Limited, a subsidiary of Adani Group, is setting up a 600-MW power plant in Surguja district of Chhattisgarh. The Adani Power Plant will use the rejected coal from Parsa East and Kete Basan mining blocks, which is expected to produce almost 60 per cent ash as by-product. This can adversely affect the people living in the vicinity, the nearby Hasdeo Bango Dam, the forests in the region and their biodiversity. The region is inhabited primarily by the Gond tribal community who are dependent on paddy cultivation and collection of non-timber forest produce. When the Environment Ministry gave its clearance for the coal blocks, it clearly stated that the plant’s location could be finalised only after consultation with the residents. It is alleged that the company decided the location of the plant on its own. A public hearing was scheduled on December 30, 2015. But a week before the hearing, people of 10 villages whose land was to be acquired decided to oppose the power plant and demanded deferment of the public hearing. This led to cancellation of the public hearing. No public hearing has been scheduled again till date.",

The right canal that connects Polavaram project with the Krishna at Vijayawada was 70-80% complete. Using the right canal which is close to ready, chief minister Chandrababu Naidu and his team proposed a lift irrigation project to give water to Rayalaseema instead of waiting for more years in drought.

Fighting for the rights of displaced people, the organisation held protests over the dam displacement. Hundreds of project-affected people have not received compensation packages for incomplete irrigation projects. The reason of the protests has been for the integrated use of water for about 2 lakh people. Only for the district of Satara we are talking for about 27000 families. But it an also be said for Sangli and Amravati districts. It has been decided by the government around April this year on the water tax and the distribution of the water resources to the drought affected families. The government has been trying to revise the format for the distribution of water since past many years. Even the land that is brought has 5 percent more price than its market value. And whether irrigated or not is another issue. This results in the hierarchy of water distribution and hence compensation be given in order for the lands which come under a certain project revolving around the construction of dam and the social costs be equalised and that the Government has not given any resolution with respect to the same since April and hence the implementation even after the approval of the costs remains a question.",

The four villages are Nimgaon, Kanersar, Davdi and Kendur. The SEZ was to be developed by Khed Economic Infrastructure Pvt Ltd (KEIPL), Bharat Forge Ltd, and Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC). However, Bharat Forge Ltd, a multinational firm, lost interest in the project when the farmers of Rajgurunagar resisted the land acquisition and started protesting. Quoting the Land Acquisition Act 2013, the farmers, led by Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, demanded the land be handed back to them as it had not been used for many years. In January 2013, the Maharashtra government introduced an industrial policy which brought forth the policy of Integrated Industrial Area. This was to give an exit route to companies that were no longer interested in developing the SEZ. Yet, KEIPL transferred the land to Kalyani Developers Ltd and made the affected farmers its stakeholders. As per the land acquisition agreement, farmers of the four affected villages were promised 15 per cent of the developed land. It was recently announced that 183.37 hectares were marked for the farmers and KEIPL would construct roads and infrastructure.",

But on June 17, 2016, the Municipal Corporation of Dharamsala (MCD) and the district administration turned its back on the city’s poor and rendered about 300 families homeless by demolishing their shanties in Charan Khad. The slum dwellers are mostly migrant workers; many of them are Scheduled Caste people of Rajasthan and Maharashtra and had been residing in the slum cluster for over 30 years. Working mostly as daily wage labourers at construction sites, rag pickers and street side vendors, these people have nowhere to go. MCD said it was merely “following High Court orders”. The residents at the settlement have not been provided with any alternative. The process of planning the demolition started three months ago and MCD had shown the slum dwellers relocation sites in villages Gamru, Passu and Sarra. The displaced people allege these villages have no amenities—housing, sanitation or water. They also say that the local residents of these villages opposed the rehabilitation and that they were kicked out. MCD made no effort to sort out the rehabilitation problem and went ahead with the demolition after serving a 10-day notice. The families were left on the streets to fend for themselves in the mosoon season. Close to 115 children from the slum were studying at government schools. Activists allege police is intimidating the displaced slum dwellers as well as those attempting to talk to them or provide support. It is unclear as to why the administration is now interested in clearing out a slum which has existed for so many years. Dharamsala was recently short-listed as a smart city after much lobbying from various quarters of the political establishment.",

Their land has been their source of livelihood. The government now plans to acquire 17.750 hectares of this land to build a township for the employees of the Bhilai Steel Plant. The acquisition is being made under the provision of 'adlaa-badli', or exchange of land between the Bhilai Steel Plant and the state government. Kalgaon residents are strongly against giving up their land. Residents have initiated the process of claiming their Community Forest Rights, as under the Forest Rights Act (FRA), which allows them to protect and conserve land, forests and natural resources within the customary boundary of their village. People see the land acquisition as a forceful violation of FRA and Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, or PESA. They say that the township will benefit only rich industrialists and powerful politicians, and the farmers will be the victim. On August 20, 2016, the government put up a notice in Kalgaon’s panchayat office asking people if they had any objection to the proposed land acquisition. In their written reply, people vehemently opposed the project. They stated that since Kalgaon falls under Schedule V Area, any land acquisition must be approved by the gram sabha. Making all efforts to retains their land, on October 2015 the residents wrote to the Collector in Kanker demanding ownership titles to their land. They even initiated the process of getting titles from the revenue department through the defined process. They took the gram sabha’s approval on August 21, 2012 and submitted the relevant documents to the authorities. But no action was taken by the government.",

Dalits work on the fields of Jats under the Baitadari System, where the majority i.e 2/3 of the produce is appropriated by Landholders (Jats), while Dalits get the minor share, despite bearing the burden of costs of cultivation.The primary source of conflict in Bhagana Haryana was the control over Shamilat land, which includes land for public purpose, vacant lands and small tracts of land which fall in residential areas due to uneven growth of the village. Out of total 4400 acres, 280 acres is Shamilat land. Shamilat lands have been an important part in the socio-cultural life of Dalit community. Dalit students who are denied from playing in the school field have converted a piece of Shalimat land into playground which is managed by the Dalit community. The problem started when the State Government acquired 70 acres of Shamilat land under Mahatma Gandhi Basti Vikas Yojana. The mentioned land which belonged to no individual, given the social dynamics of Jat-Dalit relations, was controlled by Jats. The appropriation of Shamilat Lands by the government lead to the disruption of economic as well as cultural life of Dalits, as the Panchayat which was controlled by the Jats, acquired the land and also broke the wall separating the school playground and playground used by Dalit students to capture the later and also fell down the trees thus imposing total control. However, the protest started over a triangular piece of land called ‘Chamar Chowk’ which played an important role in the community life of Dalits. The Dalit community took several constitutional methods to claim rights over the land which was eventually defeated by Jat domination in civil administration. The Dalits of Bhagna have been fighting against this socio-economic domination of Jats.Currently, the land dispute is being inquired by the National Commission for the Scheduled Caste under POA Act.",

Further, villagers are dependent on this land for minor forest products. Industrial activities on this area would lead to environmental disaster. The conflict starts when the government of Odisha converted around 92 acres of forest land to revenue land. An area of 12.86 acre of grazing revenue land has been de-reserved and transferred to Industrial Development Corporation of Odisha(IDCO) on lease for the construction of breweries. The villagers opined that,the whole process has been done without approval of central government, which is a violation of Section 2 of Forest Conservation Act, 1980. All these plots are physically dense forest having various matured timber species. If any patch of the area is being allowed for industrial activity, then the entire landscape will be adversely affected. The local villagers urge the government authorities to cancel the lease agreement if any made with IDCO as because the entire conversion, de-reservation and transfer of land is blatantly illegal.",

    "summary":"In Kaima village of Latehar district, 186.42 hectares of land is claimed by the locals as part of their Community Forest Rights. The claims remain pending. 79.72 hectares is claimed under Individual Forest Rights by nearly 80 claimants, of which only 8 have received it. There are 100 hectares of forest land in Kaima. The Forest Department sought the Gram Sabha’s permission before setting up a plantation under the CAMPA fund, but it was only for 50 hectares of land which was any way outside of the purview of the Gram Sabha. But, when the department started with plantation it also took over the land claimed under IFR by five families of the village. The Forest Department also set fire to the indigenous vegetation of the area to make room for a plantation. As a result of the plantation there, the village has been partitioned into two. Women of the village were also adversely impacted as their routes in the forest have been blocked, as well as important grazing land and medicinal herbs set fire to.",

    "summary":"Raipur Municipal Corporation has been illegally dumping Raipur city waste in Sakri village of Raipur district. The common land of the village which served as a playground and a space for the cultural activities of different schedule caste population in and around the village has been allocated to the Raipur Municipal corporation by the collectorate without Gram Sabha’s consent under JNNURM mission in the year 2012. Since then the city’s waste has been dumped in this ground of the Sakri village. In the year 2014 RWMPL was allotted the tender to undertake the waste management of the landfill in Sakri village. In the EIA report submitted by the company, the impacts of the landfill on the groundwater contamination of the village due to leachate from the waste has been mentioned. After EIA, public hearing was also organised in the village in the year 2016 where villagers protested the opening of the landfill in their village ground given the reason of air, water, and land pollution in and around the village which will impact their livelihood activity i.e. agriculture and animal husbandry and will also lead to large-scale migration of the villagers to the city slums, but still the environment clearance was granted to the company Residents of the Sakri village have given a written complaint to the RMC regarding the landfill project and has got the only consolation of better waste management practices by the company which will not impact the village in a larger way. The distance of Swami Vivekanand international airport from the village is around 9.42 km which is very close as per the DGCA norms and can result in bird hit of the flights. Objections on the distance of the landfill were raised by the Airport Authority of India. DGCA recently in August 2018 has granted conditional NOC to the landfill. Before Sakri, RMC was dumping city’s waste in the Sarona Village of Raipur which came under the scanner of NGT through a petition filed by the city-based environmentalist Mr.Nitin Singhvi. After which the NGT ordered RMC to clear the waste dumped in the village which is near the Kharun river ( a tributary of Mahanadi) and make scientific arrangement for treating the waste following the SWM rules 2006, which lead to the selection of Sakri village for the waste treatment plant.",

    "summary":"In 2006, Delhi-based firm Competent Automobiles proposed to build a 236-room resort on a 27-acre property facing the Arossim beach in South Goa. It was a franchise for the Sheraton group of hotels. It received a no objection certificate from the Cansaulim-Arossim-Cuelim village panchayat (without consulting the gram panchayat) in the same year, coastal zone clearance in April 2013 and state pollution control board’s consent in August 2014. This was when a large number of villagers began opposing the project, saying that they had no idea about it earlier. They said that the project is proposed on an eco-sensitive land, which contains orchards of coconut trees and traditional storm water drains. Although the land is privately-owned (and purchased by Competent Automobiles), it benefits the community through flood prevention and maintaining the local ecosystem. The hotel would also close the public access to the beach by building gates and the resort’s plan also allegedly threatened sand dunes on the beach, which protect the village from monsoon tidal surges. The villagers also raised concerns that the project's close proximity to two similar starred resorts would put pressure on the village infrastructure. In a special gram sabha called in October 2014, villagers unanimously rejected the resort project and also resolved to revoke the NOC granted in 2006, on the grounds that it was issued without the consent the panchayat, violating state laws on panchayat affairs. In 2016, two local community associations moved to the National Green Tribunal’s Pune bench against the coastal zone permission and a Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF) letter in 2013 that exempted the project from obtaining a prior environment clearance. On 9th January 2017, the NGT upheld the appeal and quashed the MoEF’s exemption. It has told the MoEF to examine the project for environment clearance, which is in progress. People are now waiting for the response of MoEF on the issue.",

The land has been acquired through the State Power Generation Company of the Chhattisgarh State Electricity Board. The village falls in a Schedule V area and most of the residents belong to Gond tribe. The Government has begun to build a 132/33 kV Sub-Power-Station on this patch of land that not only contains the community burial ground and the play-ground of the Government Primary School of the village, but also a shrine of tribe deity Burha Deo. Since 2014, the residents of Jawartara have been protesting against this project before multiple authorities including the Collector of Bastar and Tehsildar of Charama. They have written multiple letters to various authorities ever since the project was proposed. They have also requested the Sarpanch and the secretary of their Gram Panchayat seeking special gram sabhas to pass resolutions against the project. They have held traditional social gatherings against the project and have staged a protest before the collectorate at Kanker. However, none of these measures got any attention from the administrative authorities. Eventually, village residents have filed a Public Interest Litigation with the High Court of Chhattisgarh. Residents say that the land was acquired without necessary consent of the gram sabha of Jawartara. In the PIL, the residents have also challenged the gram sabha meetings that were held to get consent of people for this project because correct procedure was not followed. The Chhattisgarh High Court recently ordered the Commissioner of Bastar Division and the Collector of Kanker District to visit and inspect the site of dispute and to come up with an alternative plot of land. They are expected to report back to the High Court sometime in January 2017.",

Dalits now want the land they are entitled to through rules of Nazool. The struggle is on at least in 45 villages. Under leadership of Zameen Prapti Sangarsh Committee, Dalits have put camps on land they claim is theirs. Clashes with the Police across district are going on, with many protesters sustaining severe injuries.",

Farm lands close by are needed to construct the expressway. Majority of the population here depends on agriculture and dairy for livelihood. Land holding per person in this region is low, and despite new industries coming up in the region, employment opportunities for them are also poor. The only way the new industries can benefit the farmers is through compensation. They are agitated as their land has been taken away, compensation amount has not been timely paid, and there is no alternate source of income. Many affected farmers have started shifting to new farm lands in far off places, but it has not helped them much. Most of the areas are rain shadow and drought-prone regions. Farmers live under the fear of future land acquisitions due to the industrial corridor. The corridor plan has not been made public.",

    "summary":"In September 2013, the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced an airport at Kishangarh, in Ajmer. Ever since, there has been conflict over the procedure and compensation offered for land acquisition. The land acquired for the project was a two-crop, irrigated and fertile land. Due to water collection work in the upper area, a canal and a water-recharge in the wells contributed to the water needs for farming and pastures. The area received good rabi and kharif crop, apart from abundant vegetables. Animal husbandry and dairy work provided sustainable livelihood to the people. Farmers say the government should have acquired only wasteland for the project. Instead, it saved the land of a few influential and rich persons, they allege. This apart, the farmers say the administration did not inform either them, the panchayat, or the gram sabha about the land acquisition. The administration published notices in Urdu and Sindhi newspapers, which have minuscule readership in the area. The farmers got to know about the notice only after the last date to file objections had passed. They allege the government forcibly took away their land by declaring their houses illegal. The farmers question the usefulness of an airport in a rural belt and say the areas that are important for tourism and pilgrimage are already well connected. People now demand the promised compensation for their land. They say the government had promised them six times the circle rate. But the government backtracked and now the amount is much less. They cannot build a new house in the compensation amount the government plans to give now. The land given to them for resettlement will not help them continue their animal husbandry activities either, they say. The government aims to complete construction of the airport by 2017 end.",

In January 2015, they put up banners and pasted pamphlets openly warning the company. It was reported that they set afire equipment for infrastructure development. They also told the people of the village not to provide labour for any work associated with the mine. In April 2015, it was reported that Naxalites kidnapped four mining officials. The officials were released later. In October 2015, it was reported that Naxalites set afire 20 trucks in the Metabodeli-Chaargaon mines. They beat up the truck drivers and other mine officials. There was an exchange of firing between the Naxalites and the security forces. The Environmental Public Hearing held on October 5, 2016 witnessed vehement opposition from the people. They said the company did not fulfil any promise it had made while setting up the mine. At present, mining activity has started in the region, though it is sporadic.",

    "summary":"Municipal Corporation of Amritsar had decided in December 2014 to start a modern Solid Waste Management Plant (SWMP) at the existing site of Bhagtanwala, Amritsar, Punjab. The proposed facility will be designed to cater the need of eight municipal bodies including Amritsar and seven others. The residents living in the nearby areas have strongly opposed the move. Even before the decision has been taken to modernize the facility, they staged a protest for the existing dump yard . It is observed that the dumping ground is the source of many diseases in the area. The residents afraid that if the proposed facility starts its operation, it will lead to health problems to about 50,000 people living in the locality. Also, according to the ‘Municipal Solid Waste Act’ a solid waste processing plant in a close vicinity of densely populated area is not permitted. Beside this, the area is very close to a grain market famous all over the country for wheat trading.Also, the famous Golden Temple is not very far from the site. The protestors said that the area is thickly populated and the municipality has informed the government and the high court by declaring Bhagtanwala as a village. Earlier, in the mid of 2014 residents staged a 42 days long protest against the dumpsite. Following their agitations the dumpsite was temporarily closed. However, Municipal Corporation of Amritsar decided to revamp the site again. With this decision, people in that area united again to start their protest. They are even looking for legal actions to stop the construction of the proposed plant.",

    "summary":"A dam being constructed on the Kanhar River in Sonbhadra district threatens to submerge 19 villages in Uttar Pradesh and four villages each in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. Apart from impacting human settlements, the project is also expected to submerge large tracts of rich forest cover. These are official estimates. Many other estimates state that the project can submerge over 80 villages. The Chhattisgarh Water Resources Department states that the dam can submerge 17 villages in its state. The project was proposed in 1976, but was put on hold. As construction finally began in December 2014, largescale protests started. People complained of extreme delay in the execution of the project, anomalies in the land acquisition process, and old and outdated environment and forest clearances. When the matter was taken to the National Green Tribunal in December 2014, the tribunal directed an inquiry and restraint in the construction. In May 2015, the tribunal gave its go-ahead to the project because a lot of investment had already gone into the project, and much of the construction work had already been done. “Any direction for stoppage of work or demolition of the project will not serve the ends of justice or the environment,” NGT stated. In March 2016, a query was raised in the Chhattisgarh Vidhan Sabha about the rehabilitation and resettlement of the residents of the affected villages. Water Resources Minister Brijmohan Agrawal answered that the dam’s construction had been put on hold and an assessment survey was being done to identify the affected areas. He assured that the Chhattisgarh government will not allow the dam to start functioning till the Uttar Pradesh government completed the rehabilitation and resettlement process.",

    "summary":"The project to build a new greenfield international airport at Rajgurunagar has been pending for the past 14 years. It aims to reduce air traffic at the Lohegaon airport, and fulfil Pune's need for a strong international connectivity—the city has emerged as an industrial hub in the recent past. Discussions to set up the new airport began in 2002. Then, it was to be constructed near Askhed Budrukh, Koye, Kurunde and Piet villages. The place is 20 kilometres from the present site in Khed sub-division. Ever since it was proposed, the project has faced strong opposition from farmers of the adjoining areas who will have to vacate their land for the new airport. Construction of the airport requires 40 per cent government land and 60 per cent acquired land. In August 2012, the Maharashtra government allocated Rs 200 crore to acquire 1,800 hectares. Of this, 1,200 hectares were set aside to construct the airport comprising two parallel runways of four kilometres length and 60 metres breadth. The remaining 600 hectares were for airport amenities, commercial development, and to rehabilitate the farmers and other project-affected residents. The land belonged to the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), which was handed over to the Maharashtra Airport Development Company, the airport planning authority. The project has received clearance from the Airport Authority of India. The chief minister also informed on social media that in September 2, 2016, the Airport Authority of India will visit the site for preliminary study. However, the farmers of Khed and Shirur sub-districts organised a protest. They said the land acquired earlier for Khed Special Economic Zone would be transferred to the airport project. MIDC officials claim they know nothing about any protest by the farmers for the 186 hectares promised at the time of land acquisition in 2007. Government officials maintain that the project will cause minimum displacement as most of the land is non-agricultural.",

People of Rajala, Fatehpur, Kasturi, Sakri and Saraiya villages, whose land was procured for road widening, were paid rates as per residential category. These people demand that as per set government norms, their land comes under the commercial category and, therefore, their compensation should be upwardly revised and arrears paid. Residents have decided to stall the construction of the NH-77 if their demands are not met. Tirhut Divisional Commissioner Atul Prasad has constituted a six-member committee to resolve the issue.

    "summary":"In November 2014 Railways and district land officer started measuring land to acquire around 20 acres of land in Ramdayalu-Turky village, Muzaffarpur district for electrification of rail line. Land was required to erect electric poles on both side of the railway tracks. Around 20 to 25 families living along side the railway track protested and demanded compensation for land acquisition. District land officer after matching the land records found that the families have no legal right over the land. Indian Railway wrote to the state government to get the land vacated along the Ramdayalu railway track. In the meantime, residents challenged district administration claim that they do not have rightful ownership of the land. Electrification work was initiated in 2015 under heavy presence of police force but residents' protest forced the police and engineers to stop the work. In 2015, FIR was lodged by police against 35 people in Kudhani police station for stopping the work in 2015. To resolve the dispute, a three-party negotiation was held among residents, railways officers and district administration. It was decided that district administration will once again look into the land records to verify whether the land belongs to the residents or not. It was also decided that police case lodged against 35 people will be withdrawn. On 31 Jan, this year, a team of engineers started erecting poles at the disputed site. Again the residents forcibly stopped the work as promises made during the negotiations were not fulfilled. Residents demanded that the district administration and police should take back or cancel the FIR lodged against 35 villagers in 2015.",

In 2013, Surat Municipal Corporation issued a notice that allowed Nagarpalikas of south Gujarat to dump their waste and garbage at a location in Khajod village. People of 35 villages located near the site had demanded the closure of the facility at Khajod. MSH Sheikh, an environment expert, who had also been campaigning against the site’s existence for the last several years went to the NGT against the polluting site along with Parivartan Trust, an NGO operating in Gujarat.Residents of nearby villages were afraid that foul smell would create health problems for a lot of people living in its vicinity. SMC had been dumping its solid waste without segregation at Khajod site for the past 18 years. The pollution caused by repeated fires in the waste spread heavy air pollution in 10 km radius, causing health issues in Khajod, Budiya, Gabeni, Dipli, Jiyav and Bhimrad villages.Finally in 2017, on NGT’s orders, the SMC identified three plots of land at Bhandup and Mandroi in Olpad taluka and Wankinada near Palsana-Kadodara in Surat district to shift its solid waste disposal site from Khajod. Work towards closing down the Khajod site is yet to begin.",

Villagers said, mining at Danga Deulo will not only affect the ecology of the region but will also act as a threat to their lives as it will erode the soil and hit agricultural activities.

The protest is being led by Ganesh Mahali, a leader of ruling Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP). Mahali told www.landconflictwatch.org that nearly 200 displaced and affected families of the mining project are regularly denied job. “UCIL being a government company should ensure that displaced get the preference for work as they gave up their land to pave way for mining,” he said. Mahali alleged that it’s difficult to believe but it’s true that company has outsourced jobs to private companies that do not ensure enough job days for displaced. “If this is not enough, jobs are allotted to outsiders. Villagers are extremely angry,” he added. Heavy police deployment was made to control the anger of protestors. UCIL management and district administration tried to bring agitating villagers on the negotiation table. However, villagers refused to start negotiation without written assurance. The stalemate was finally broken after district administration and UCIL called for a tripartite meeting to resolve the issue. The meeting will be held on July 27. This is not the first time protest has marred the Mohuldih mines. In 2012, villagers locked horns with UCIL over wage rate fixing. The Mohuldih mining lease is for 288 acres and UCIL has decided to expand it further and add 35 acres of land. It has an investment of capital work in progress of Rs 71 crores for the fiscal year 2014-2015.",

This is a clear violation of the rules under the Forest Rights Act because Gram Sabhas were not involved in the rights allocation process. The Forest Rights Committees issued the community forest rights to Joint Forest Management Committee and not to the Gram Sabha. Also, the tribal community is not satisfied with the area demarcated under Community Forest Rights (CFR) because it does not cover their traditional forest boundaries, which are wider than the area allocated by the Forest Rights Committee. The community submitted the application to the tribal department and local authorities to change the name of the title holder from the respective Joint Forest Management Committees to Gram Sabha in 2013. They haven't received any response yet.",

In 2013, members of Bhatia Samaj moved High Court alleging that the members of Muslim community have expanded the graveyard beyond the land dimensions allotted to them. The court constituted a committee to check the allegation. The committee found that the graveyard exceeded the limit. Then the members of Muslim community moved to Supreme Court which ordered a stay and asked to maintain status quo. On July 3, 2017, when some members of the Muslim community went to the graveyard to bury a dead body, people of Bhatia Samaj objected saying that the matter is still pending in the court. District collector Kailash Chandra Meena said that the matter is sub-judice. It is a communally sensitive matter. We are dealing with it in a best possible manner, said Meena.",

    "summary":"Around 38 residential and agricultural land owners of Bikram village have accused the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) and the state government for paying less compensation for their land that has been acquired for construction of bypass road connecting National Highway 98 to Hazaribagh. A compensation of Rs 70 crores has been already paid to about 242 families whose land has been acquired. Around two square kilometer of land has been acquired for the construction of bypass road. Land owners accuse that the compensation paid to them is far less than the market price of the land. They also claim that officials of NHAI and state government had assured of more payments but now they have refused to make the payments. The project is a part of The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH) plan to enhance transportation in backward regions. It has selected 33 different National Highway stretches with approx total length of 3770 km for upgradation. NH 98 is being upgraded to two lane connecting Patna with Hariharganj in Hazaribagh. A major portion of the highway falls in the Left Wing Extremism affected area. Senior engineers of NHAI claim that compensation package has been given to the affected families as per the norms specified by the state and central government. However, displaced families are seeking revision in the compensation as per the new Resettlement and Rehabilitation package notified by the state government. Residents claim that compensation for agricultural land has been doubled and for commercial land package has been quadrupled by the state government. Furious over the partial payment, residents have stopped the construction work at the bypass road and also at a portion of NH 98. Protestors are demanding an additional payment of Rs 70 crores for 242 families. The bypass road is a crucial lifeline to the NH 98. If the bypass is not constructed at Bikram then vehicles will have to travel nearly 40 km extra to Arwal to connect with NH 98.",

    "summary":"The project for expansion of Ib Thermal Power Station (ITPS) under Odisha Power Generation Corporation (OPGC) of Odisha government has encountered strong conflict with local people over land acquisition. People of Tilia gram panchayat (GP) in the Lakhanpur block of Jharsuguda district have opposed the land acquisition by the government on the grounds that the earmarked area has been fertile agricultural land and the only source of livelihood for people. Without this patch of land, people will only starve in this area, the Sarpanch of Tilia GP, Thana Sundar Sahu, told the Land Conflict Watch. The forest land of about 84 acres used for the new units of the power plant has also been the source of food and livelihood for many, he added. Sahu claimed the expansion will cause serious health issues to people as the OPGC plans to set up its ash pond in the region. The ash pond will lead to public health hazard by polluting the air and water of the river Mahanadi, Odisha's biggest river system, and people in the area will have to bear the brunt of it. The government has made payment of INR 12 lakh per acre to some people as compensation against land it has acquired. This is a meager amount because people are losing their perennial source of livelihood, allege the village residents. Owners of 30 per cent of the land acquired have, however, not yet received any compensation money. Most of them are small land holders. Despite opposition from people, the district administration has started work in the area in presence of 20 platoons of the police force in April. OPGC authorities are tightlipped on the issue maintaining that the land acquisition is not their job. Keeping in view that the villagers can't live a healthy life if the ash pond is set here, people now demand that the government acquire the whole habitation and rehabilitate them with land for housing and agriculture so that the villagers can settle together in another place. People settled in the affected villages are once displaced by the Hirakud dam project. They are now facing a similar situation again for the Ib Thermal Power Expansion Project, a joint venture between OPGC and the American energy major AES Corporation. The project envisages to set up two more units, Unit 3 and 4, each of 660 MW power production capacity.",

Some of the displaced families were resettled and compensated for their land, while many are yet to be resettled and receive adequate compensation. The land acquisition reportedly happened in phases between 1986 and 2004. The displaced community members of Gevra, Dipka, Kusmunda and other mines in the region have come together to jointly protest against all the mining activity in their region. They are together raising demands for employment opportunities for all displaced families, fair compensation, rehabilitation and resettlement.

    "summary":"A land conflict has been going on in New Delhi's Kathputli colony, so named for its dense population of puppeteers. Thousands of puppeteers had settled on the open land in West Delhi's Shadipur region 60-70 years ago. The conflict started in 2007 when the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) sold the land to the Raheja Developers, as part of a Public Private Partnership (PPP) project for the in-situ redevelopment of the area. In 2009, the Raheja Developers, announced the construction of Raheja Phoenix, “Delhi‟s first true skyscraper”, a 54 floors of luxury flats, on the current Kathputli Colony plot. According to the Plan, the residents of the colony would have been shifted temporarily to camps in Anand Parbhat, about four kilometres away, for a period of two years, wherein the project would have been built and the people rehabilitated in their own area. The total area of 5.2 hectares got sold. Out of this area 60% was marked for the rehabilitation of the colony and the rest 40% for the Raheja commercial plan. In 2013, when the residents of the colony got to know about the eviction plan, they started to resist the eviction. In march 2014 the DDA and Police Force entered into the slum area with the bulldozer and tried to evict the people from the colony. Many people got injured, 23 people accused of false charges. On the night of August 11, 2014 Dilip Bhaat, the chief of the colony was allegedly lifted from his house and beaten up by the police force. All this in spite of the order of prohibiting use of force by the Hon. High Court. One of the controversial aspects of this conflict regards the modalities of the the rehabilitation, and the incorrect number of families recognised by the DDA ( 2,800 families against the 3,500 claimed by the local people - Petitioners submit a list of 495 families who have not been included in the DDA list of eligible families). Today the colony is still fighting, and numerous letters and complains have been filed by the residents of Kathputli against DDA, MLAs and MPs. The residents are waiting for a written document, which will decide the modalities of the relocation; this needs to be done together with the community. Only 4 months ago the DDA came back to the colony to speak with the residents regarding the relocation plan, but still not a single step have been done to respond to the residents demands of houses and rights.",

    "summary":"The iron ore mining project in Raoghat is about 30 years old. But it’s only over the past few years that the region has witnessed intensive activities. The proposed mine can displace the people of 35 villages. The bulk of the population here comprises the Gond adivasis. To protest against the project, Badri Gawde, a local social worker and political activist from the region, founded the Raoghat Bachao Sangharsh Samiti. When the movement gathered steam, Gawde was arrested in January 2014 on charges of being a Naxalite. It is largely believed that he was falsely framed. The local court convicted him, but the Chhattigarh High Court granted him bail. His case is ongoing here. After Gawde’s arrest, Dharam Korche, a farmer from Hapra village, assumed the leader’s mantle. But Korche was also arrested in June 2015 under flimsy charges. Residents believe the arrest was made to send a message to the dissenting people. The movement draws strength from the Forest Rights Act, 2006 and the Panchayat (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996. The two laws empower the adivasis to claim their rights over their land, forests and forest produce. The laws also give the gram sabha final discretion over their land. The movement against the Raoghat mining project is to protect the rights of the people as under the two laws. But the threat of getting arrested is now acting as a deterrent to the movement. The proposed mining project has been challenged in the Chhattisgarh High Court for irregularities in the Forest Clearance processes. The case is ongoing. In January 2016, SAIL announced that it will not operate on Raoghat Iron Ore and will assign a private outsider for the job.",

    "summary":"A solution seems likely to the stalemate over land acquisition at four villages in Kudhni block of Muzaffarpur district for construction of National Highway-77. Villagers had been protesting low compensation packages and filed cases in various courts. The stalemate forced the district land acquisition department and National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to find a solution. After a marathon two-day meeting, the authorities decided to approach the villagers so as to break the deadlock. The district land acquisition department and NHAI have decided to approach 500 villagers to withdraw the compensation-related cases filed in the arbitration courts. Once the cases are withdrawn, NHAI and district administration will pay them compensation that is four times the present offer. The new rates are in line with the new lease policy of NHAI and state government. State government and NHAI are planning to acquire 1.2 hectares in Sikri village, 304 hectares in Madhaul and 0.8 hectare in Daraipur. But villagers are not happy with the solution. They feel the state government and NHAI act like businessmen when it comes to paying compensation. They say confusion prevails over land categorisation. Villagers want residential land to be priced under commercial land category and agricultural land under residential land category.",

In Kalana village in Ahmedabad district, the state-owned Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) offered to buy 365 bighas (1 bigha equals 1,621 sq.m) of land from farmers for Rs 350 crore in 2013. Excited by the offer, village residents gave their consent. But in 2015, GIDC decided not to purchase the land, leaving residents in the lurch. They are uncertain whether they will regain possession of their landholdings. Unless their landholdings are returned, they will be unable to carry on farming or sell/mortgage property to secure a bank loans. Similarly, in Khoraj village, near Sanand town, GIDC acquired 6,000 bighas at the rate of Rs 26,15,800 per bigha. But three years after it began the acquisition process, 20 per cent of payments are held up. According to the Land Acquisition Act of 2013, GIDC must pay farmers four times the market value of land but the agency is unwilling to do so and is insisting on making payments as per the old Act dating back to colonial period. Officials are also coercing farmers to accept three conditions if they want compensation: execute a sale deed under old compensation rates, forego interest on their land and agree not to approach courts.",

The area where the SIR was proposed is predominantly an agricultural stretch with no industrial presence and the proposed project would affect the livelihood of farmers. Even after the government narrowed down the number of villages to set up the SIR, three of the remaining eight villages refuse to be a part of this project. Farmers from these three villages are opposing the government's decision and carrying out rallies against it. They refuse to leave farming, which is their main source of living, and become industrial labourers. More than 50 per cent of their land will be taken over for the SIR and they left with hardly any land for agricultural activities.

To increase its capacity to 26 MTPA, the Coal Ministry published a notification in July 2014 to expand the mines by acquiring land from five villages—Amgaon, Churail, Khodri, Khairbawna and Gevra. The Adivasi communities living here oppose it, and say they did not receive an official notification of the land acquisition. In February 2015, a public hearing was organised which met with strong resistance from the residents. People complained the company had not yet fulfilled the promises it had made to the people whose land was acquired for the existing mining. Despite the opposition, the expansion did not stop. Public hearing is only consultative in nature. It does not hold veto power. In November 2015, it was reported that the company, which was already operating at a capacity more than approved, had started floating tenders to further expand the mines’ capacity, without appropriate clearances. Environment activists opposed this. Gram sabhas were also held against the expansion. But neither community rights nor individual forest rights were granted to the residents. In September 2016, Coal India Limited informed that it will offer the 10-MTPA coal washery in Kusmunda to operate on Build-Operate-Maintain basis.",

They were protesting against the non-inclusion of land acquisition details in the project report. It did not mention how the bridge’s approach road would be constructed. Villagers feared the government would acquire their land forcibly without paying compensation. They had submitted several memorandums to the district administration and the state government to make the land acquisition process and the compensation details transparent. Debvrat Sahni, a local activist, had thrice gone on hunger strike to highlight the issue of missing land acquisition details in the project report. Sahni and the villagers demanded that government should make public the total land it would acquire and also reveal the compensation amount. Arthur Ghat Bridge is almost 80 per cent complete. Bihar Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam Limited (BRPNNL), which is constructing the bridge, has already started work to construct its approach road. This has angered the villagers since public disclosure of the details was not made. They have forcibly stopped the construction work now. A BRPNNL junior engineer said efforts are on to convince the villagers to allow construction work. He said the process to finalise the acquisition of 8 hectares for the approach road has begun and the government would soon release the details of land acquisition and compensation amount. The engineer said if villagers do not allow construction, all work on the bridge would stop. But the villagers are not convinced with such verbal assurances.

Villagers around Gorghat Bridge, which connects National Highway-80, have refused to give their land because of an unresolved water dispute. Villagers fear the proposed approach road would stop Ganga river water from reaching their farm lands. They have sought solution to this problem before signing acquisition papers. Similar protests have marred the construction of an approach road to Agwani Bridge with villagers demanding compensation at the commercial rates instead of agricultural rates. The protests forced the land acquisition officer to go slow. Any delay would escalate the project cost.

It was to be developed as part of the Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor over 3,664 acres in the Bawal Assembly Segment. In the meantime, some farmers moved the high court against the land acquisition and they got a stay order in June 2014. Later, the High Court vacated the stay while disposing of a petition filed by nearly 40 farmers, pleading that they wanted to give their land for the project. The stay was not vacated on the land of those farmers who opposed land acquisition and were the applicant in the earlier case. Since the stay was vacated, the state government resumed the land acquisition process, prompting farmers to restart their agitation. Significantly, the BJP had at that time supported the farmers and promised that of not acquiring their land if it came to power in Haryana. Nevertheless, it continued with the land acquisition process by serving notices under section 9 of the act on 7th November 2014. Bawal farmers are demanding compensation for their land acquired.",

    "summary":"Gera Developers, a real estate firm active in Maharashtra and Goa, has proposed to build a residential colony ‘Enchanted Woods’ on a hillock in Candola/Khandola, a ward in the Betqi-Candola village panchayat in Goa. This is being opposed by the residents of Khandola, who say that the hillock consists of forest area, cashew plantations, and is integral to water security and ecological balance in the area. The residents first learned about the project in December 2012 when they heard loud drilling sound from the hillock. Using Right To Information, the villagers found out details about the residential project. They started to block trucks going to the site and set-up barriers on the road going uphill. The police arrived, allegedly at the behest of the company, and removed the barriers. The residents formed a committee, the Betki Khandola Samvardhan Samiti, which began collecting evidence about the project. They found that it had received environment clearance and the panchayat’s no objection certificate in 2011, but that the Panchayat did not make these clearances public to people. Additionally, the Town and Country Planning department approved plans that showed construction on a steep slope, which is a no-development zone as per zoning laws. In 2014, the Samiti filed a writ petition in the High Court of Bombay at Goa challenging the TCP clearance. Inspections ordered by the Court further revealed that while the environment clearance was for a residential project for 600 persons, the town and country planning’s clearance was for 2500 persons. The Samiti also pointed out that the clearance did not mention any flora, fauna or forests, while their own measurements had revealed 14,000 square meters of densely forested area. The High Court in 2016 ordered that a fresh clearance be taken. The company received the clearance in October 2016, but it was again not made public by the village panchayat, and the clearance letter removed a clause that made it compulsory to send a copy to any NGO involved in the project matter. The Samiti has now filed a fresh petition in the High Court against the environment clearance.",

    "summary":"In 2011, the Gujarat government decided to construct a barrage on the Narmada river near Bhadbhut village in Bharuch district, as part of the Kalpasar project. This project is supposed to be one of the biggest in the world as it proposes to construct a 30 km long dam across the Gulf of Khambhat between Bharuch and Bhavnagar districts. The reservoir is supposed to trap the water of twelve rivers including Narmada, Mahi, Sabarmati, Dhadar and some Saurashtra rivers that empty their water in the gulf. The project is expected to have a reservoir of 2000 sq km area, over five times the area of Sardar Sarovar dam. The barrage is aimed at curbing the salinity ingress that has affected potable water sources and local industries. However, some fisher folks have been protesting against the Bhadbhut barrage, fearing it would affect their fishing activity. In the estuary between Narmada near Bhadbhut where sweet and saline water meet, large quantity of Hilsa and Palwa varieties are found. If the barrage or causeway is constructed, fishing will be severely affected, they claim. On July 19, 2014, about 1500 farmers and fisher folks attended the public hearing which was about constructing 1 km weir-cum-causeway, and walked out soon after sharply registering their protest. The causeway still waits environmental clearance. About 4000 fisher people also organized a protest rally at the District Magistrate office. According to a local source, currently Hilsa arrives at least during monsoon as the river stretch of 130 KM holds rain water. If Bhadbhut barrage is built there will be no free flowing river stretch to support fish breeding. The barrage approach is 7.29 km long. The affected area is of a flood bank plain which fisher folks use to access waters for fishing. This area would be diverted into the barrage through a box type central drainage structure.

While many coffee planters favour the tiger reserve due to the huge compensations that would be paid, the tribes and others at the lower end oppose it.",

    "summary":"The crucial Patna-Buxar four-lane project has been stuck for almost five years now due to problems in land acquisition. Farmers are demanding a higher compensation for their land. Last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for a part of the project, raising hopes of speedy completion of the project. Nearly 557 hectares is needed to broaden the road to 60 metres. In 2013, farmers protested the road’s alignment as it passed through a large stretch of farm land. Due to farmer’s protest, the contractor, Gammon India Ltd, decided to quit the construction work midway. Farmers allege the government is not paying the right price for acquiring their land. They claim that National Highways Authority of India gives four times the price of what the state government has offered. Farmers have now refused to sell their land for the project. So far, the government has acquired only 20 per cent of the land required for the project. Construction was planned in three phases. The Patna-Koelwar stretch needs acquisition of 165 hectares while the Koelwar-Bhojpur-Buxar stretch needs 193 hectares. Farmers, who agreed to acquisition, were paid 50 per cent of the amount in 2014. Same year, the government revised and doubled the land acquisition rates in favour of farmers. Now, farmers, who were already paid compensation, need to be paid nearly double the amount under the new rate. This has escalated the project cost.",

Construction and pitch-laying began in 2012 simultaneously with the land acquisition process. The 30 families, whose lands were acquired, were told they would receive compensation by the end of 2013. But the amount, totalling around Rs 50 lakh, has not been paid. People forcibly stopped construction work in 2015. Recently, the district magistrate ordered that road work should be started to relieve the city of traffic snarls. But angry residents decided to forcibly stop the work.

In the second phase, nearly Rs 4.93 crores was to be paid to 234 land owners. Bihar state road development corporation’s delay in payment has led to nearly 30 litigations in various courts of the state. It has led to series of protests and also delayed the project work by nearly two years. Road renovation and broadening was expected to be complete in last year. But keeping in view the non-release of funds, project was extended till June till year. If the work is not completed by March next year then a revised project proposal will increase the cost of the project. To make the matter worse, some of the villagers angry over the non-payment have decided not to sell their land.",

    "summary":"Tiruchirapalli airport, or Trichy airport, was established by the British during World War II, and was primarily used by the British Airforce. The airport has been undergoing expansion since 2004. The second phase of the expansion includes extending the runway by 3,810 metres, construction of a modern air traffic control tower, and an additional building complex. The Airport Authority of India (AAI) has sought around 205 hectares for the expansion. The state government has decided to give the authority the land for free. Of this, about 76 hectares is dry land, 47 hectares is wetland, 66 hectares is defence land, 16 hectares is Poramboke, and 2 hectares is with the religious and charitable trusts. To speed up the expansion process, a joint technical advisory committee involving the departments of agriculture, revenue and the public works were formed. The district administration formed a special team to expedite the land acquisition process. The technical advisory committee states that land will be acquired in three phases. In the first phase, land on either side of the existing runway will be acquired. In the second phase, wet and dry land will be acquired. Defence land will be acquired in the final phase. The farmers of region, particularly of Keezhakurichi and Nathamadipatti villages have been consistently agitating against the acquisition of agricultural land and for building a runway across the Uyyakondan canal. Residents also contend that the airport expansion would leave them without a direct link road to the city. The Nathamadipatti-Golden Rock Road is the main access to the city. This will be closed down once the land is taken over by AAI, and people will be forced to take a very long detour.",

    "summary":"Land conflict in Dighi Port Industrial Area is between farmers and Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC). The corridor is a Rs-6,042.60 crore mega infrastructure project in which Japan is a major investor. In December 2006, an Indo-Japan Task Force was created and a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the two countries. DMIC covers 1,483 kilometres comprising seven states—Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra—and union territories Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu. In Maharashtra, the project focuses on two areas—Shendra Bidkin Industrial Area and Dighi Port Industrial Area. Protests against Dighi Port Industrial Area have been ongoing since 2012. Dighi Port Industrial Area has five industrial areas under it. The land here is mostly fertile and paddy is grown in abundance. The corridor needs about 28,000 hectares in Dighi village of Raigad sub-district. This will leave people of 78 villages landless. In the first phase of the project MIDC acquired 5,700 hectares, and another 6,000 hectares in the second phase. Due to farmers’ opposition to the project, MIDC reduced the quantum of land to be acquired. At present, about 12,000 hectares is notified in Raigad. Farmers complain the project will displace a huge population and cause loss of agricultural land and other natural resources. In April 2016, National Alliance of People’s Movements held a two-day convention. It was organised jointly by National Alliance of People’s Movements, Indian Community Activist Network, Sarvahara Jan Andolan, Jan Sangharsh Samanvay Samiti, Mines, Minerals and People, and Delhi Solidarity Group. The convention was against what they called the “corporate corridorisation of India”. Ulka Mahajan of Sarvahara Jan Andolan says when notifications were issued for acquisitions, there was no plan for the community.",

    "summary":"In October 2015, 5,000 farmers of 42 villages belonging to Vanthali and Junagadh blocks of Junagadh district had protested in front of the district collector’s office demanding that their villages should be excluded from the new Junagadh Urban Development Authority (JUDA). There had been another protest meeting in the same month where about 2,000 farmers gathered to oppose JUDA. The Town Planning Act requires farmers to hand over 40 percent of the land for developing city infrastructure, and hands over rest of the 60 percent land at a different location. The main reason behind the resistance is that people wish to continue with their occupation as agriculturalists and inclusion in Urban Development Authority (UDA) will automatically mean a deduction of nearly 40 percent of their land making agriculture next to impossible and leaving them with the only option of selling their land.",

    "summary":"The Kota and the Toda share overlapping grazing lands in the Glenmorgan area of The Nilgiris, falling under the jurisdiction of the Nilgiris North Forest department. Both these communities are among the particularly vulnerable tribal groups in Tamil Nadu (TN) and have traditionally been buffalo keepers. The villages involved in this conflict are the Todas of Tarnad Mund and the Kotas of Sholur Kokkal. Around 2011-12, some Kotas from Sholur Kokkal lay claim to the grazing lands in between their fields and those of Tarnad Mund (specifically the hamlet of Pudu Mund). The Kotas claimed that about 1800 acres of land had been allocated to them through a grazing patta. Further, they claimed that buffalo rearing is on the decline because their numbers (the Kota) have increased and that they were losing cattle to wildlife raids. They argue that their traditional occupation of buffalo grazing is not enough to support them anymore and therefore, they want to convert their traditional grazing rights to agricultural rights (agriculture being perceived as more lucrative than buffalo rearing). The land being claimed by the Kotas has been claimed as forest land by the Forest Department. Over the last 3-4 years, the Revenue Department has also become involved because part of the land, they claim is under the Revenue Department. The conflict has been with the Forest Department and the Revenue department. The Forest Department considers the conversion of grazing land to agricultural land a problem; traditional grazing rights of both Todas and Kotas have been recognized by the Forest Department. The land under conflict is also partially under a revenue category called the 'Toda Patta' land - a revenue assignment by the British to the Toda. A parallel conflict has been with the Todas claiming that part of the land being converted to agricultural use by the Kotas is of ritual importance to them (the Todas) and needs to be isolated from other communities. There have also been allegations (by Forest Department) that the Kotas have in fact leased out this land to non-tribal members of the adjoining village because they (the Kotas) were unable to raise enough capital to cultivate the land. Some of these non tribal members have also been arrested by the Police. (The Hindu report, 2013)",

    "summary":"In 2011, land of 1850 farmers residing in Sindhaul, Bagriya, lahurimau, Rampur Bandh, Dharchhuva, Asvaar Mau, Sirsa and Kasimpur villages in Kanpur was acquired for a 1980 megawatts power plant project by Nevali Lignite Corporation (NLC). While the work on the project is still going on, farmers from all the affected villages are protesting to get a fair compensation. Farmers are demanding that they should be paid the compensation whichever is higher, the circle rate or the market rate. Along with that farmers are also demanding that they should get an additional compensation for not being able to cultivate the land for 6 years, during which the project could not be commenced. Farmers' demand for the additional compensation is based on the new land acquisition act, which says that if the project fails to start within 5 years of the acquisition, the developer will have to pay the compensation on the increased value of the land. From December 2016 to January 2017, During a protest which went on for almost a month, two of the farmers' leaders Niranjan Singh Rajput and Vishakha Rajput were jailed by the Kanpur police under the Gunda Act. The project is a joint venture between Uttar Pradesh Rajya Vidut Uthpadan Nigam Ltd and NLC.",

    "summary":"In one of the Uttar Pradesh's most backward district Lalitpur, Shishir Bajaj-led Bajaj Group came with its project of setting up a 1980 MW thermal power plant (Three units of 660 MW each) in 2010. According to the local farmer groups, land acquisition for this project was done in an arbitrary manner. Many families are still waiting for their compensation. According to the news reports, more than 1000 acres of land was acquired by showing it barren in the papers but in reality, the acquired land falls on the part of the land irrigated by Sajnam and Utari tributaries. The project also came under the radar of National Green Tribunal (NGT) in 2015, when a petition was filed against the plant for unlawfully using the water from the Dam on which thousands of farmers depend for irrigation. NGT ordered an inquiry into the matter. The case is pending. Farmers and labor groups are also protesting against the plant because it has yet not delivered the promises it made of jobs and electricity to the village residents.",

In a recent meeting held in Gandhinagar secretariat, the state tribal secretary also blamed tribes people for the delay. He has been quoted as saying there has been strong opposition from the local people of Tapi and Valsad disricts to measurements by the agencies appointed by the state government to carry out the job. However, it is not clear why 142 claimants have been sent rejection letters despite all the attached proof. These 142 households, whose claims were pending since 2011, plan to appeal in a court against this en-mass rejection.

These farmers have been staging an indefinite dharna (protest) at the Saidpur village for the past few years. The locals said the Haryana State Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation had been constructing a boundary wall around the acquired area even as the farmers of villages had not given possession of their acquired land.

    "summary":"The KSK Mahanadi Power Project is located in Janjgir-Champa district of Chhattisgarh. Although Janjgir-Champa is the least forested area of Chhattisgarh, lacks coal, and has widespread agriculture, it has been identified for construction of atleast 34 power plants. As a result, the entire district faces issues of land acquisition and ecology due the disposal of various industrial effluents in the land, air and water. The KSK Mahanadi plant had 6 units each of 600 MW. The first two units have been commissioned whereas the construction of the rest is in different stages. The project received its Environment Clearance (EC) in 2009. However, the land acquisition for this project had begun in 2008 itself through various mediators. The land acquisition for this project has faced a lot of protest from the community of the region. Initially, the land was bought from the farmers for very low prices. However, after the Chhattisgarh Revised Rehabilitation Policy and the continuous protests by the affected community members, a little better compensation was offered. But only a few farmers were benefited because allegedly some influential families received much better compensation. The affected community members launched a protest in January 2011 against the land acquisition. There were repeated reports of violence against protesting farmers by the Police. In 2011, the issue of unlawful acquisition of a dam for this project which was spread over 130 acres was raised in the State Legislative Assembly which resulted in the creation of a committee to set up an enquiry to investigate the matter. The dam had been dismantled and the community land was given for private and commercial use in the project which is illegal as per the orders of the Supreme Court. In September 2014 too, there were protests against the company for not providing adequate employment and other facilities which was assured to the affected community members. Over the years, the company has developed a reputation for exploiting the local community and carrying out various unlawful practices. It has faced issues with the Labour Department over breaching Minimum Wages and Labour Laws. In May and June 2016, various protests were carried out by the affected community members who were promised employment, were not given permanent and respectable jobs by the company. The Congress Party which has been continuously in the opposition over the last decade has been raising these issues from time to time. Last updated: 26/1/2016",

A few months later, farmers started to protest against the problematic land acquisition that took place for the project. They claimed that they were not given adequate compensation for their primarily agricultural land and were cheated through the involvement of the middlemen. Farmers made various protest demonstrations to the Sub Divisional Magistrate, Collector and other administrative officials in the region. Women played a major role in taking the movement forward. People who were protesting also faced repression from the police and the company. Since then, the affected farmers have been continuously making representations to various state bodies against the fraudulent processes carried out by the company while setting up the project. Some of their allegations also include the deliberate obscuring of facts related to the wildlife which can get potentially affected by the project. They allege that the Environment Impact Assessment was misleading because it did not take into account the region being a part of the Elephant corridor or other migratory patterns among the wildlife. Despite the continuous protests by farmers, both the units of the project were commissioned in 2016.",

    "summary":"To feed iron ore to Bhilai Steel Plant, the South Eastern Central Railway, support by the Central government, has started construction of the 235-km Raoghat Railway Line. It will connect Dalli Rajhara, Raoghat and Jagdalpur. The first phase of the project—a 100-km stretch between Dalli-Rajhara and Raoghat—has started at an estimated cost of Rs 1,200 crores. The stretch between Raoghat and Jagdalpur will be constructed in the second phase at an estimated cost of Rs 2,000 crore. People living in the area oppose the project. They say their land has been taken away for a railway line they do not need. Naxalites have also expressed their opposition to the project. Numerous incidences of violence and intimidation of workers by Naxalites have been reported. This is perceived as a major reason for the delay of the project’s completion. To combat Naxal threat, the state has heavily militarised the Dalli Rajhara-Raoghat-Jagdalpur stretch. The entire area has a large number of security camps.",

    "summary":"Unscientific construction is threatening the 400-year-old Fatehsagar Lake. The construction has not affected anyone yet, but protests and the subsequent filing of a case mark the beginning of a conflict. Fatehsagar is the largest of four lakes in Udaipur, and holds about 427 mcft of water. The lake has been witness to detrimental activities such as digging of deep borewells, and haphazard drilling of trenches. It has resulted in collapse of earth and silting of the dam. Experts warn of an impending disaster in the Fatehsagar dam. Many tubewells were dug in the lake bed between 1995 and 2010. These still exist, though they are not in use. Many more tubewells are situated very close to downstream of the dam. Unrestricted digging of tubewells in the dam’s safety zone is a norm here. The state government has now decided to construct a park in the Fatehsagar Lake area. Work of Vibhuti Park is in progress. This may tamper the dam’s structure. As per norms, downstream of the dam up to a minimum of 500 metres is deemed as dam safety zone, says Anil Mehta, member of non-profit Jheel Sanrakshan Samiti. No activity can be permitted here. However, the dam safety division of the state department has not taken cognisance of the violation. Under threat is now the centuries old dam and subsequently the lives of the people living in the downstream area.",

The dam is meant to hold 0.8 million acre feet of water to feed 11 major power projects downstream in the Chenab river basin. There are 12 villages—Darcha 1 and 2, Sumdu, Limkyum, Rarik, Gandaj, Balijim, Yoche, Chikka, Dogma, Nama, Ranglyo and Makseen—which will be completely or partially submerged once the dam is commissioned. It will displace more than 250 families; 40 shops will also be submerged by the dam reservoir. As many as 10 villages, including Jispa, Kaimur, Khangsan, Sorang, Kalong, Rangrik, Kwaing, Sitangiri and Kwang will be impacted by drying up of water sources due to construction of 18-km-long head race tunnel. Following protests by the tribal community, the Himachal Pradesh Power Corportaion Ltd (HPPCL) suspended the project survey work in September 2016. The dam, which was declared a project of national importance, is being opposed by residents of 14 villages. HPPCL has already invested Rs 3 crore in the project and has stated that it would begin study work only when locals extend their support.The Chenab basin in Himachal, which so far has been free of hydropower projects, today has 20 projects lined up in a stretch of 130 km, in an attempt to utilise every stretch of river that offers a vertical drop.",

    "summary":"The Hasdeo-Arand coalfield is spread over three districts—North Korba, South Surguja and Surajpur. The region is one of the largest intact forest areas in the country and among the few pristine natural forests. The forests include the Dharamjaigarh forests, span over 2,000 square kilometres, and are extremely rich in biodiversity. The region has 30 coal blocks, which are mapped and identified. Of these, 16 were allocated to public and private companies. But the allocations were cancelled later after a Supreme Court order. At present, mining is operational in only three coal blocks. Residents say it is being done with largescale violations, and have legally challenged a few. In 2010, the environment ministry identified the Hasdeo-Arand region as a ‘no-go’, or ‘mining prohibited’ zone. However, in 2011 the ministry granted Stage–I forest clearance to three blocks, reportedly under pressure from other ministries. Though the coal blocks were allocated to the Rajasthan government for power utility, a company of the Adani group is mining there. The company is the mine developer and operator. In January 2015, 20 gram sabhas passed resolutions opposing auction of coal mines in the Hasdeo-Arand region. They did so under the provisions of the Forest Rights Act 2006. In January 2016, the Chhattisgarh government cancelled the community forest rights of the tribals of Ghatbarra village in the region. The government argues that the tribals were using community forest rights to oppose coal mining. Residents say the cancellation has questionable legality. The tribals of Ghatbarra are not willing to give up their land and have decided to move court and launch protests. People know the impact mining has on environment and human lives from the experiences of other mining activities in the surrounding areas. On June 5, 2016—World Environment Day—people of 35-40 villages wrote to the Prime Minister drawing his attention to their concerns related to environment and biodiversity conservation in their region which is under threat because of coal mining. On September 11, 2016, an Environmental Public Hearing was organised for the expansion of Parsa East Kete Baasan coal mine. The public hearing was reportedly scripted and manipulated by people hired by the Adani coal company. Cash and liquor were openly distributed. Some people were even threatened. Those who expressed resistance to the expansion of the mines could not get their voices registered in the public hearing, people allege.",

The land acquisition was an issue as few farmers had objected that it would take away 400 hectares of irrigated land. The district administration, on June 25, initiated land measurement for expansion of Karad airport, near Varunji village, 1.5 km from Karad. The airport is spread on 65 acres and the acquisition of more than 100 acres had been proposed. Some 450 farmers from Varunji and Kese villages demanded talks with Chavan. Also Padali, Munde, Supne and Vijaynagar villages were going to be affected. The lift irrigation scheme for 3,200 acres of farmland had to be acquired as mentioned by the leader of the Shramik Mukti Dal Dr. Patankar. 2012 - The airport was given approval and even funding of Rs. 95 Crores and 64 lakhs and an area of 45.82 hectares. This was done in vision to increase the eco tourism in the Koyna area (Koyna Wildlife Sanctuary, Koyna Dam etc). 2015 - Despite a positive response earlier, the Karad airstrip expansion is now facing a major opposition for land acquisition. There was a meeting of the farmers organisation (led by Dr. Patankar) on 21st April to decide the next step in opposition of the airport or let the administration decide about the compensation for the same. This airport is also proposed to join the Mumbai airport.",

    "summary":"Loktak Lake in Manipur is the largest fresh water lake in north-east India, marked by floating islands of biomass, called phumdis by local people. The lake is spread over 286 sq km and the largest floating island on it, Keibul Lamjao, is the world’s only floating national park and home to the endangered Sangai deer. Families living around the lake and on the phumdis depended on the lake for their living. Their means of living was threatened when the state government brought into force the Loktak Lake Protection Act of 2006 to conserve the lake and develop the area for tourism. Hundreds of families were evicted from the phumdis in 2011. Some moved to the side of the lake to continue fishing, some others shifted to other areas of the district in search of livelihood after they received some compensation from the state. Some families that stayed along the lake at that time were safe from eviction. When their family size increased, they moved to a new area in the village alongside the lake with the permission of the gram panchayat. In 2013, they were evicted from the area by the government—the local MLA said that the area needs to be cleaned and beautified for tourists. The families then moved to the Sendra public ground adjacent to the lake. On August 3, 2016, the government evicted them from this place, too, without offering any alternate place to stay. The eviction happened after the club of the Sendra ground wrote to the local administration in December, 2014, to grant it permission to run a parking lot for tourists. In January 2015, on the direction of the sub divisional officer of Moirang city, the office of the assistant survey and settlement officer conducted a survey of the club land. After the field survey, the officials again asked the families to move, saying that land is government property. The settlers filed a case in Manipur High Court. Though the court issued a stay on the matter on August 3 till August 29, the huts, the club and the facilities built for the tourists were razed by the state government two hours before they received a copy of the order.

The Forest Clearance, however, for this project still seems unclear. The Chhal mine is owned by South Eastern Coalfields Limited (SECL), a government of India undertaking, but is presently being operated by the Jindal Group. The company has shown very poor compliance of the terms and conditions mentioned in the Environment Clearance. The residents of the Lat village, where the mine is located, were promised jobs by SECL. According to reports in October 2016, 22 families are still to get jobs. Of these 22 families, 11 even conform to SECL policy norms that requires that families should have had given away at least 2 acres of land to be eligible for a job. As these few affected families continue to live in the village which has now completely been surrounded by the mining activity from all directions, their everyday lives face adverse effects of the mining activity. The villagers are demanding employment from the SECL Company on the basis of High Court judgment that asked the company to give employment to members of every affected family and scarp the condition that a family should have given away at least two acres of land to get a job.",

    "summary":"The Government of India upgraded the Coimbatore Airport to international status on 2 October 2012. This led to the proposed expansion of the airport which includes extension of runway to 12,500 ft (3,800 m) to accommodate larger aircraft and construction of a parallel taxiway to the runway to minimize runway occupancy time and turnaround time of aircraft. Two more parking bays are to be added, raising the total number of bays to ten. Consequently, residents of GKV Nagar, Chinniyampalayam, Kalapatti, Neelambur, and areas that come under the Irugur Town Panchayat have been protesting against land acquisition for the airport expansion. GKV Nagar is part of the 627.89 acres of land that the government intends to acquire to expand the airport. This project, which was planned 15 years ago, has been pending for 7-8 years because 134.32 acres ear marked is defence land. Of the 134.32 acres, 122.12 acres is attached to the Air Force, 6.38 acres to the Navy and the remaining 5.82 acres to the Army. The rest are agricultural lands, house sites and government poromboke land. Private land holdings have been divided into 23 blocks and the rate was fixed for the blocks in a phased manner. The rate fixed by the government was considered very low compared to the market price. The locals are expecting twice the current market price which is Rs 3,500 per sqft for the land that the district administration will acquire for the expansion of the airport. The locals demanded that the Chinniyampalayam to Irugur Road and Venkittapuram to Kurumbapalayam Road will be disconnected when the runway and new approach road to the airport are laid. They demand that the government should lay 40 feet wide service road alongside the boundary of the airport to make the nearby private lands usable. Landowners also are expecting better compensation for house sites, houses, trees and wells that were part of the land under acquisition for the airport and runway expansion and tax exemption for the compensation. The issue is now before the High Court.",

    "summary":"The Govt of Gujarat sanctioned to Nirma Ltd. 288 hectares (720 acres) to construct cement factory and 3000 hectares (7500 acres) for limestone mining in 2008. The grant was given after the Indian Minister of Environment and Forests granted Environmental Clearance to Nirma on the basis of rapid environmental impact assessment (EIA), that describes the project site as a wasteland. Nirma then obtained in-principle approval from the state to mine limestone from 3,460 ha in Mahuva’s Padhiarka village to feed the cement plant. Part of the project site was a reservoir, Samadhiyala Bandhara, and its catchment, spread over 100 ha. Farmers used the reservoir water to irrigate their fields and therefore the allotment triggered widespread protests. Around 5,000 people protested against the loss of agricultural land which farmers use for onion and cotton production. The MoEF, on 11 March 2011, issued a show cause notice to Nirma under Section 5 of The Environment Protection Act, 1986 for permanent suspension of work and revocation of the environment clearance granted to the cement plant, captive power plant and coke oven plant. The Supreme Court directed the MoEF to call for the report of an expert body consisting of five independent reputed scientists(XV) on 18 March 2011. This body unanimously concluded that the site of Nirma’s industrial complex must be relocated outside Samdhiyala Bandhara—a common property resource—and its periphery (Babu 2011). Based on this report, the MoEF cancelled the environment clearance given to Nirma for the cement plant at Mahuva on 1 December 2011 and filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court stating the same on 8 December 2011. In February 2012, Nirma moved the NGT. In January 2015, NGT delivered final judgment and set aside the revocation order of environment ministry. Acquitting Nirma of any wrongdoing, the NGT has now asked the Gujarat State Pollution Control Board to monitor the project for a period of two years to see what “the effects of the running of the project on the water body” will be.",

Till date not a single CRs and CFR have been distributed, and the claims are still pending at the SDLC level. In January of 2010, more than 500 forest dwellers invoked their rights under FRA and took charge of forest land outside Jaldapara wild life sanctuary. Soon after, however, there was police harassment of the activists fighting on behalf of the tribal communities, as the fight for the FRA continued. North Karbari, a village of 95 households, in March/April 2013 successfully resisted a clear felling coupe attempt at Mantharam, braving threats and harassment by police, local political leaders, and forest department. In 2014, hundreds of gram sabha members came together and with the support of the Uttar Banga Ban-Jan Shromojivi Manch they opposed the felling of forests in Jaldapara wild life sanctuary. In that occasion, a case was registered against five members of North Khairabari Gram Sabha, namely Rabi Rava, Subhas Rava, Kutin Rava, Sarbat Rava and Bipin Rava under sections 34, 186, 341 and 353 of IPC case no 514 dated 18 January 2014. On January 2017 the FD demanded to the North Khairabari Gram Sabhas the permissions for tree-felling. They strategically approved the demand for cutting about 450 trees, for an area of 15 hectares, by submitting a resolution with their demands, asking for the recognition of their Forest Rights and the management of their forest area.

    "summary":"The conflict over the illegal land acquisition of government land by the wife and son of BJP Minister Brijmohan Agarwal in Mahasamund District, Chhattisgarh began in 2009 and came to the fore only in March 2015. Even though the alleged land acquisition by Sarita Agarwal - the wife of Chhattisgarh BJP Minister Brijmohan Agarwal (currently minister of Water Resources Department, Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Fisheries, Ayacut, and Endowment) is recorded in September 2009, no complaints were filed till 2015, when Lalit Chandranahu of the Kisaan Mazdoor Sangh Mahasamund filed a complaint. In 1994 the previous owner of the land, Vishnu Ram Sahu along with five other farmers had handed it over as 'daan' to the Water Resources Department, supposedly under Madhya Pradesh “bhu-rajasva” (land revenue) Act, 1959. Officials representing WRD had told him that a government project was to come up in the area and in return for his land, he and his family would receive jobs. After this point, both the records and the ownership of the piece of land in question were mired in ambiguity and controversy. No project came up in subsequent years and no jobs were given. In 2009, Sahu claims that some dalals (middlemen) came and told him that the land records hadn’t changed and that they would buy the land from him. According to a government probe after the 2015 complaint, it was revealed that the 4.12 hectares land was moved from the possession of WRD to the Forest Department for an afforestation project, which never happened despite having spent Rs. 22.90 Lakh on record in 2003. It was subsequently bought by Sarita Agarwal in 2009. According to Indian Express, various governmental bodies including the Forest and Water Resources Department concluded that the land belongs to the government, but due to a “laxity of records”, remained with Vishnu Sahu who sold it to Sarita Agarwal. Apart from these 4.12 hectares, 13.90 hectares of government land were encroached upon by Brijmohan Agarwal’s family. According to Indian Express, Mahasamund District Revenue Officials red-flagged these 13.90 hectares and issued a show-cause notice to Aditya Srijan Pvt Ltd, the company which acquired the land and has Sarita Agrawal and Abhishek Agrawal, the wife and the son of Brijmohan Agrawal, as its directors. The case assumed even bigger proportions when new records from the tehsildar documented 49 instances of acquisition of government “patta” land, totaling 26.83 hectares which were meant for farmers and tribals. 2.35 hectares was acquired by Abhishek Agrawal and 11.82 hectares by Aditya Srijan Pvt Ltd. The rest were acquired by two associates - Arjun Singh and Abhiman Sunani. Two companies – Aditya Srijan Pvt. Ltd. And Purbasa Vanijya Pvt. Ltd. (where Abhishek Agarwal is one of the directors) are building a resort called Shyam Vatika on a portion of these various acquisitions totaling 44.85 hectares. The case is being tried in court and has even been raised in the Parliament. At least 32.19 hectares can be directly attributed to the Agarwal family. All of the acquisitions discovered till now are wrought with ‘faulty records’ or outright encroachment on government land.",

At the same time, the allottees were frequenting the developer's office for registration of their flats, only to be put off again and again.Last year (in 2016), the allottees also approached the Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) to register a complaint. But there was no investigation by the LDA. With renewed hope after the state government's fresh, strict directives against builder's arbitrary behavior, the allottees have again approached the LDA with their plea.

    "summary":"Since 2009, multiple tehsils and villages in Raigarh District of Chhattisgarh have been battling against illegal and deceitful land acquisition mediated by middle-men for big power companies. While Benghari, Khokhraoma, Katangdi and Nawapara Tenda in Ghargoda tehsil have been frequently reported in National and International Media, villages in Kharsia, Dharamjaigarh and Tamnar tehsil (all in Raigarh District) have witnessed similar incidents. Threats by local mafia, deceitful contracts, forgeries, forced waste dumping and even murder have been alleged against village middle-men and companies like Saptarishi Infra Tech Estate. In Ghargoda tehsil, about 100 farmers have lost over 680 acres of land between 2012 and 2017 to two companies - TRN Energy and Mahavir Coal. Some were threatened to sign blank papers, while others were duped into signing. In Tamnar tehsil, hundreds of residents from 14 villages have reported cases which could fall under Section 170 (B). In Kunkuni of Kharsia tehsil, more than 300 acres of land has been transferred by forgery. The Press Information Bureau of India reported that Jailal Raithiya, the man who brought to light these forgeries, died under mysterious circumstances. Despite signs of a possible poisoning, his body was cremated without a post-mortem. In June 2017 a group of 80-90 farmers from Ghargoda tehsil filed complaints against the two companies at the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Welfare (Special) Police Station under Sections 170 (1 and 2). However, police decided to do preliminary investigations before filing FIRs. The Adivasis believe that their reports were not taken seriously by the police. A member of PUCL claims that over 140 such cases have been filed by them in Ghargoda in just the past year. However, even the 15 that had favorable outcomes out of them have been appealed to the District Collector by the companies. Lawyers and activists report that everyone in Raigarh has a similar story to tell. It is impossible to reach an accurate figure of the number of total land grabs in Raigarh, but Naiduniya puts it at 580 based on police reports. In just the four villages of Ghargoda Tehsil which filed the most recent complaint this year, around 900 acres of land has been acquired by private firms according to Amnesty International. The overall figure in Raigarh is reported by Naidunia to be over 2000 acres. The outcome of the legal battle remains to be seen. However, despite the flurry of protests and complaints since 2012, there has been little progress for the Adivasis of Raigarh.",

    "summary":"Mahaveer Energy and Coal Benefication Limited (MECBL) - a subsidiary of Mahaveer group of companies (http://mcwpl.com/site/group.php) in Chhattisgarh, has set up a 12 MW biomass power plant in Bhengari village of Raigarh district. Apart from this power plant, Mahaveer group also operates a 540 MW thermal power plant in the same village and will soon be setting up a coal washery unit here. It is alleged that between 2009 and 2015, the group acquired land from the tribespeople living in the region through forgery. Reportredly, the agents of the company coerced Bhengari residents to sell their land. An Amnesty International correspondent spoke to Kalamati Rathia, an adivasi woman from Benghari village, who said: “I had two acres of farmland at village Bhengari which I got from my father. A middleman for Mahaveer frequently visited us and compelled us to sell our land. One day along with other villager, they took me to another person’s house where they took my signature and gave me 2,000 Rupees. We thought that the company had purchased our land, but the sale deed listed someone else’s name as a purchaser.” Similar incidents of forgery were reported from the nearby villages where another company TRN energy used threats and intimidation to displace tribals off their lands. This led to village assemblies in the affected villages issue a resolution against these companies in 2015 and 2016. The resolution said that their lands had been purchased through fraud and coercion. Complaints of affected residents and activists in the region highlighted the issue at various levels of the government. On 9 May 2017, the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes directed the district administration of Raigarh to take action under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act in cases where adivasi land was transferred to other people through forgery. The order followed recent allegations that over 300 acres (121 hectares) of adivasi land had been unlawfully transferred to non-adivasis in Raigarh between 2009 and 2015. On 14 June 2017, 150 adivasi individuals from four villages in Raigarh district came together at the district’s Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Welfare (Special) Police station to submit criminal complaints against MECBL and TRN energy under the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act (PoA). These complaints have been accepted but an FIR will be lodged only after the ‘preliminary enquiry’ to determine if a cognizable offence had been committed or not. Amnesty international India wrote to TRN Energy on 27 April 2017 and to MECBL on 3 May 2017 seeking their response to the allegations of Adivasi communities. The companies have not responded to date. The farmers whose land was taken by forgery and without any compensation, demand that their land should be returned to them. Some farmers who land was acquired at low prices, damand that they should be given better compensation.",

Work on a part of this section in Amdanga region of North 24 Parganas district is stalled because of compensation related issues. In 2009, the Indian government allocated INR 2,000 crore in the central budget for this work. People in the Amdanga region demand better compensation for their 42 hectares of land that was acquired for the widening. They say that they are not against the highway widening but deserve better compensation and rehabilitation package. According to Land Acquisition Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act of 2013, people should be paid four times the value of the acquired farmland plus INR 5 lakh per family if there is no job prospect in future or a job to a family member or a monthly annuity of INR Rs.24, 000 per year for 20 years with adjustment for inflation. A newspaper report says that the National Highways Authority of India had handed over the money to the Bengal government, but the government is not distributing the money as per the 2013 act. According to The Committee on Protection of the Rights of the Victims Due to the National Road Expansion, about 19000 families have been affected in this area, which includes some shop owners and footpath dwellers. Sayed Ahmed, secretary of the Committee was quoted in media saying that people will not allow the extension unless they are paid proper compensation. People have protested several times in front of officers of local authorities demanding better compensation.",

Gujarat government has approved six Town Planning schemes on a 902 sq km Dholera SIR, which includes a smart city. In the latest round, farmers whose property fall under Town Planning scheme No 1 (51.40 sq km) were sent eviction notices to vacate their agricultural plots. The notices require the farmers to part with 50% of the land. The notices were served following reports that Dholera SIR was given environmental clearance to go ahead with setting up smart city and industries in the region. A farmers’ delegation, met the Town Planning officer, to enquire about eviction notices being sent to farmers even after a stay order by the Gujrat High Court dated Dec 2015. Farmers had gone to the court opposing the SIR project in 2014. About 28,000 hectares of land belonging to the farmers and being acquired under DSIR provisions, is fertile agriculture land and fell under the Narmada canal command area.

The tribals argue they have no alternative livelihood options outside forests and are work as contract labour at construction sites in urban areas. They allege they have been given meagre compensation for relocation and the government did not construct houses for them at the alternative site. The tribals allege the forest staff has been continuously harassing them by filing false charges and putting them in jail as they try to re-enter their ancestral land.

    "summary":"In 2009, around 10,000 acres of semi-arid grasslands that have traditionally been used to graze the indigenous cattle breed, Amrit Mahal, in Chitradurga district of Karnataka, were parcelled out to various research institutions and industries. The grasslands are also the home of the Lesser Florican, the Great Indian Bustard and the blackbuck - all protected species. The region is famous for the blankets woven from sheep wool. The grasslands are also important sources of medicinal plants and minor forest produce for the community. The state government has sanctioned the space to the DRDO, ISRO, IISc, Karnataka Small Industries Development Corporation and a private company, Sagitaur Pvt Ltd. With help from Environment Support Group, the local community have been opposing the handing over of their grasslands to industry. A PIL filed by ESG states that several of the institutions (such as DRDO) had begun construction even before environmental clearance was granted. In addition, the area was fenced off, reducing community access to the grasslands. ESG also says that these are district forests under the Karnataka Forest Rules. However, the state forest department says these are not recorded as forests anywhere in government records and are just grasslands. Since the PIL came up in front of the NGT, the MoEF has clarified that at least one third of the 10,000 acres are deemed forests. In February 2014, the NGT ordered that all construction be halted as requisite permissions had not been obtained. In August 2014, the NGT directed the state government and MoEF to allow the projects to move forward only if they were in accordance with law and on ensuring clearance conditions were “verifiable and measurable” and open to public review. The Tribunal also decided to restore cultural, economic and social rights of local pastoral, artisanal and agrarian communities that suffered and specifically instructed the project proponents not to build walls and obstruct in any manner Right to Life and Livelihoods and access to water of about 70 villages directly dependent on the Kavals. The Supreme Court of India affirmed the Tribunal's decision on 31st July 2015. The court said that the project proponents can't block community access to land and they must share information to public scrutiny. Media reports however indicate that implementation of the order particularly the sharing of information hasn't taken place. The court order is more in terms of immediate relief but the communities say their fundamental opposition to the diversion of the grasslands to industry has not been addressed. The communities are opposing the projects in toto.",

There are already 31 mini and micro hydro projects in the area and Monpa is arguing that they should be made functional before any big project. The project still does not have forest clearance. The affected land is of two types -- farming and forest, much of which is community forest.

The SEZ will provide space to different types of industries, such as textiles, automotive industry and engineering industry. Land Acquisition for the project is in process. The residents of these villages are resisting the project as they do not want to sell their land to the government under its land pooling policy. They want the 2013 Land Acquisition Act to be implemented as that would fetch them higher compensation.",

The aim is to develop Multimodal Transit Transport system to the North-eastern states through Myanmar. The transit route is envisaged between Kolkata and Mizoram. To construct this road, the government has taken many private lands and promised the owners compensation. The government claims to have disbursed Rs 9.27 crores to 165 identified land owners. Later, around 800 more people claimed ownership of the land. Demanding immediate compensation, they stopped construction for weeks. To keep the situation under control, 3rd Batallion Mizoram Armed Police comprising 100-odd policepersons were stationed at the construction site. As time goes by, waste dumping issue and change of land rate has created further problems. There have been complaints that construction waste was not disposed of at the right place resulting in ecological degradation. The issue remains unsettled as parties have refused to come to a mutual agreement.",

They called off the agitation only 48 days later after the government assured them that it would distribute cultivable land to all landless tribals in each district. When the government didn’t fulfill its promise, in 2003 Adivasis walked into the Muthanga Wildlife Sanctuary, bordering Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, and set up makeshift accommodation. The government tried to evict them using force, turning the forest into a killing field. According to an official account, two persons, a tribal and a policeman, were killed in police firing on February 19, 2003. But tribals dispute this version, alleging that 16 Adivasis had been shot dead. Over the years, both the Left Democratic Front and the United Democratic Front governments in Kerala have ignored the tribals' repeated demand for land.

To protest the acquisition, farmers organised several protests. On September 9, 2015, police resorted to lathicharge to break a protest demonstration. People fled and, fearing further police action, left even their homes. They alleged that police had set afire one of their houses and injured children and the elderly. Later, 41 farmers were arrested and kept inside Naini Jail in Allahabad. Sahdev, a 65-year-old farmer, died in police custody.

Sahara had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Government of Odisha on February 7, 2009, and also a supplementary MoU on April 9, 2010, for change of site from Tusra to Titliagarh tehsil since the original site was not found to be suitable. The pact was for setting up of two 660 MW super critical units at a cost of Rs 8,000 crore. Of the total 812.25 acres needed for the project, 510.73 acres has already been acquired. The environment impact assessment (EIA) for the project is over and application for grant of final environment clearance for the power plant has been submitted to the Union ministry of environment and forests (MoEF). The company has urged the state to expedite final water allocation for the power plant. Sahara has received assurance letter for supply of 53 cusecs from Tel river. Even though the proposed thermal power plant is yet to come up, people have started raising their voice against it by holding rallies and demonstrations. As this region is close to a river, people produce a lot of paddy, mung, horse gram and crops, besides vegetables. Moreover, the project will acquire 600 acre of private land. This would deprive several people of livelihood. The protesters approached Supreme Court, which ordered status quo. However, farmers continue to protest.",

In December 2008, GSFC started working towards Jatropha cultivation in 132 acres of the land, which led to widespread protests in the village. As a result, the company had to suspend its work in April 2009. Villagers had proposed to GSFC to distribute the land to the land less farmers and cultivate the plant in partnership with the company.

    "summary":"In 2016, National Green Tribunal had admitted a case against Essar Group's upcoming port project in Salaya, Jamnagar district, Gujarat, on the grounds that it is affecting the ecology of Gulf of Kutch Marine National Park as well as mangroves and coral reefs in the vicinity, besides endangering the livelihoods of over one lakh fishermen. The case was filed by the Salaya Fishermen's Association and 10 individual fishermen working near the proposed port at Salaya village and was admitted by the NGT's Western Zone bench in Pune on 21 September 2016. The fishermen claim that the port was granted environment and coastal zone clearance in 2009 based on wrong information about its proximity to the marine national park. The petition says that the environment impact assessment, on which the clearance was given, does not mention mangroves or coral reefs. The fishermen also allege that the public hearing, which happened in February 2008, was an ”eyewash since it happened in a school 32 km away and no notice was circulated in their village. The environment clearance was first challenged before the Gujarat High Court. In September 2011, a bench of the HC consisting of the then Chief Justice SJ Mukhopadhya had barred Essar from cutting mangroves or destroying flora and fauna and indulging in any activity around the park. In 2015, the HC had transferred the case to the NGT's Western Zone bench in Pune. Essar had moved the Supreme Court against this transfer, which the apex court subsequently stayed. In their petition before the NGT, the fishermen claim that Essar has used the stay as the ground for restarting construction activities, even though the SC had not stayed the Gujarat High Court's earlier stay order on construction at the port. The petition claims that the jetties, once constructed, would occupy most of the sea face and affect the livelihoods of over one lakh persons dependent on fishing activities. In 2017, the NGT then appointed a three-member Court Commission to ascertain exact area being used by Essar Bulk Terminal Limited to construct two jetties.",

Sometime ago, the state government advertised a lottery of plots on that land. That led Prem Saran, who is a former Sarpanch of the area, file a Public Interest Litigation in the high court against the project. The PIL says that the land is recorded as forest land which people of the village were using for their livelihood and that the project will pose a threat to the bird population in the area. The matter was heard in Jodhpur High Court and then the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ordered Rajasthan government to figure out who owns the land and settle the matter. This year, chief secretary of Rajasthan and additional chief secretary (forest) decided to give the land away to UIT for housing project. Saran has once again challenged the matter in the Jodhpur High Court. He claims that since 1957, the government is giving away the forest land to its institutions which is reducing the area on which people depend. In the past the local government had alloted about 1000 hectares of forest land to National Camel Research Centre.",

The state forest department identified 18 villages in the core area of the tiger reserve, to be relocated. There is a total of 42 villages in the Tiger Reserve. The residents of these villages depend on the forest for firewood, small timber, cattle grazing and collecting other Non-Timber Forest Products. They belong to tribes like Rawas, Mechs, Santhals, Oraos and Garos. In 2009, the West Bengal government announced a relocation package of Rs 10 lakh for every adult living in the villages in the core area of the Buxa Tiger Reserve. Just when some families had decided to take the money, the state government revised the amount to Rs 10 lakh per household. That dissuaded the families from taking the compensation. Now the residents of the 18 villages demand that first their land and forest rights should be recognized under the Forest Rights Act. According to Forest Rights Act (FRA), the government should first recognize the rights of the indigenous people living in the forest, and then plan any kind of relocation. Lal Singh Bhujel, who represents Uttarbanga Van Jan Shramajeevi Manch at Buxa, has been educating people about their rights in these villages. Bhujel says that it is only after the rights of the residents are settled, they will hold a gram sabha to discuss relocation.",

DVC’s power plant is running at half it’s capacity with power generation of 450 to 500 MW because of lack of ask pond. Around 180 families of Kariawa Village claim that they don’t want to give their land for the polluting thermal power plant instead they will part with the land only for an agriculture-related project. Koderma district administration has implemented Section 144 and initiated the construction work under the supervision of a heavy police force. Villagers on the other hand are getting ready to stop the construction work. The power plant was inaugurated in 2008 and its first phase was completed in 2014. Koderma SDO, Pradeep Kumar Bardiyar said that the trench mark were being laid to earmark the area of the ash pond. And in the meantime, district administration is trying to convince the villagers that the thermal power plant will not spread pollution and it will follow the rules laid by the central and state pollution control boards.",

    "summary":"Mopa greenfield airport is a proposed international airport in North Goa. It will be spread over 2200 acres of land, making it the largest land acquisition in independent Goa. The land is situated on a laterite plateau, consisting of forests, grazing lands, orchards and farms under seasonal cultivation falling under the territory of six villages situated on the slopes of the plateau. Farmers and traditional cattle grazers known as Dhangars are among those affected. Around 100 farmers organised as the Mopa Airport Affected Farmers Committee have been objecting to the land acquisition and staged protests outside district administration offices, since the process commenced in 2008. The farmers alleged that the government has not outlined a rehabilitation plan for the oustees, offered poor compensation rates, and forcibly acquired their land. They moved the High Court of Bombay at Goa against the land acquisition, but this case was dismissed on the grounds that the right to compensation superceded right to property. A challenge to this is being heard in the Supreme Court. The farmers alongwith an environment NGO, Federation of Rainbow Warriors, have challenged the environment clearance accorded to the airport before the National Green Tribunal bench in Pune. In November 2016, the NGT bench ordered a status quo on relocation of farmers until the case is decided upon. In a bid to appease the farmers, the state government increased their compensation. However, farmers refused saying that they wish to continue their traditional occupations and not part with the land at all (see: letter by farmers in attachments). According to a reply in Rajya Sabha in December 2016, 618 persons have been awarded compensation out of the 7,869 persons eligible. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the airport in November 2016, albeit not at the venue but at a remote location, 50 kms away from state capital Panaji, reportedly to avoid conflict. The Goa government has awarded a 40-year construction and operations contract to the GMR Group to start work on 7th May 2017. The contract has a clause that in case of delays due to land acquisition, GMR would be compensated at Rs 6 lakh per day by the Goa government. The project costs around Rs 3000 crore. Mopa airport captured public attention in 2009, bringing together civil society organisations, citizens and even sections of the Roman Catholic church under banners such as ‘Goans for Dabolim Only’ and ‘Maka Naka Mopa (I don’t want Mopa)’. The government claims that a new airport is needed as the Dabolim airport, a defense airport, cannot be expanded.",

People from Budia and surrounding villages use the lake for multiple purposes including washing of clothes and irrigating farms. Their cattle drink water from the same lake. Residents of these villages also allege that the fumes from the company is causing them multiple health problems including asthma, cough and even cancer. They demand that the government should intervene to have the company safely dispose its waste. Earlier in June 2015, 100 persons were detained by the police after a protest for the same cause turned violent. Part of their 18 hectares is 200m from the well and lake of Budia village.

    "summary":"The Lloyds Metal and Engineering Limited (LMEL) received permission from the government to mine iron ore from 348.09 ha of Bhamragarh Reserve Forest in Gadchiroli District. The lease area is near Bande village whose residents depend on the Bande River for agriculture and for drinking water (Executive Summary of EIA of the Project). Surjagarh hill, which falls in the mining area, is considered to be sacred by tribals in the region. The mining project has been stalled several times due to opposition from the local tribals. The region also has a strong presence of the banned organisation CPI (Maoists) that has also opposed the project. In 2013, Maoists killed the vice-president and two staff of Lloyd group (see Telegraph, 2013). Later there was political opposition to the project as well as locals demanded more jobs in the plant (Times of India, 2016). Recently, on December 5, 2016, about 70 gram sabhas' representatives from the region, tribal leaders, local social organisations and political leaders gathered in Surjagarh and passed a resolution to democratically halt the mining and demanded that the government cancels all present and proposed mining leases. They also passed resolutions to implement the Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006 and Panchayats Extension to Scheduled Areas (PESA) Act to protect the livelihood of forest-dependent people (the Scroll January, 2017). However, mining did not stop despite the opposition of local tribals. On December 24, 2016, suspected Maoists torched about 80 mining trucks belonging to the company and its contractors (https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161225/jsp/nation/story_126705.jsp#.WMvU...). Since then, the situation in the region has been tense and a heavy police force has been deployed.",

    "summary":"In 2008, a PIL filed in the Madras High Court asked that some 500 acres of the Segur Plateau be cleared of human habitation after the Wildlife Trust of India identified it as an important elephant migratory path. Based on the court's directive the state government published several versions of a map demarcating 5 elephant corridors extending over 2800 ha. The maps were contested by the local communities and the many resorts that were affected (some 50 odd resorts). In the meantime, the tribal community (about 300 families) also field a PIL asking for their rights to be settled under the Forest Rights Act, 2006. The extent of the corridors has been hotly contested with some wildlife biologists, locals and resort owners saying the entire plateau does not need to be protected and that there are several corridors which are free of disturbance and if these are protected, it would be adequate. In 2011, the Madras High Court, based on the state forest department's map, gave the resorts 3 months to vacate the land and said that they could not claim compensation. This order was stayed by the Supreme Court where the matter continues to languish. In 2016, 1000 acres of revenue land in the corridor was notified as reserve forest by the forest department. However, there is still no word on settlement of forest rights or rehabilitation measures that would be extended to the local community. Local villagers are demanding their rights under FRA be settled before the forest department takes control of the land. The court case is still pending and in the meantime there continues to be some police action periodically and continued tension and uncertainty for the villages.",

    "summary":"The Andhra Pradesh government signed a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with Lepakshi Knowledge Hub Pvt Ltd (LKH) in December 2008 for establishment of an Integrated Global Knowledge Hub/Multi-Product Special Economic Zone in Gorantla and Chilamattur mandals of Anantapur district. The project envisaged generation of employment for up to 1.5 lakh people directly and other indirect employment opportunities in a phased manner. As per the terms of the MOA, LKH and its subsidiaries were to invest Rs 8,000-10,000 crore in phases over a span of 5 to 10 years. As per government orders, the Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (APIIC) handed over (April-October 2009) 8,844.01 acres to LKH in various villages of these mandals. Based on the request of LKH in August 2009, APIIC issued it a no-objection certificate (NOC) to mortgage its title deeds for allotted land with banks for obtaining loans. Based on a similar request by LKH in May 2010, APIIC issued it another NOC to enable it to obtain loans from IDBI Bank for its associates/group companies. LKH, thus, mortgaged 4,397 acres allotted to it for the project and facilitated its subsidiary company Indu Projects Ltd.(IPL) in raising a loan of Rs 790 crore in June 2010. Of this amount, IPL has not spent any money on the project, but utilized Rs 562 crore on its own ventures. Similarly, 1802.25 acres were mortgaged by LKH with various other banks/entities like SBH, Central Bank of India, L&T Infra and Canara Bank. As of November 2011, LKH has not established any industry in the 8844.01 acres allotted to it by the government in December 2008, nor has it created any employment in the area. The land is lying unused without any activity on it. The land was acquired using the 1894 law and not the 2013 law. A raging battle is being fought both on ground and in the courts, respectively by the locals.",

Due to the compensation row, the LDA could not make any progress. There is a status quo in the matter. Recently, the LDA administration was reported saying that the authority is going to use the process of land pooling to convince the farmers.

It will also provide rail connectivity to Kamakhya Nagar and Bhuban in Dhenkanal district. The government is claiming that not a single person will be displaced, however, people living in 49 villages in Dhenkanal, seven in Angul and 13 in Jajpur districts will lose their agricultural land. The government sent the land acquisition notices to the villagers in the year 2007. The conflict started when the affected villagers under the banner of Duburi- Anugul -Sukinda- Railway line Khyatigrasta Chasi Suraksha Committee (Committee for the Protection of Farmers Affected by Duburi- Anugul -Sukinda Railway line) demanded higher compensation as per the market rate and land for land. On March 22, 2016, the villagers vehemently protested when construction of the railway line started. The work was stopped for nearly two hours. However, the work resumed after police rushed to the spot and arrested 14 persons. The village residents sent a memorandum to the district collector stating that without holding any Gram Sabha or Palli Sabha to seek the consent of land owning farmers for the proposed land acquisition, the government adopted a draconian approach to acquiring their agricultural land by unleashing violent police repression against the villagers. The villagers of Mangalpur and others have not yet taken the compensation amount and demanding to ensure proper compensation as the provisions made under LARR Act 2013 in respect of land acquisition in their area.",

They were given land, registered in their name in lieu of their homes in Tehri. Now, more than three decades later, the problems in the area are apparent to the residents. Attacks from animals, mainly elephants and leopards, from the Rajaji Tiger Reserve, is a fear that the 14 remaining families of Raiwala constantly live with. In 2013, 32 families were relocated to Rishikesh, the 14 were not. When the relocation was done, the 32 families and the 14 were divided by a stretch of vacant land. The area where the 32 families lived was in the corridor used by elephants. Therefore, only those 32 families were relocated, Range Officer of Motichur, Rajaji Tiger Reserve, Vikas Rawat said. However, over the years the animals have started attacking people from the other side of the vacant plot, where the 14 families live. In the last three years, 14 people have become victims of leopards and elephants. My daughter was picked up by a leopard last year. We just want the Uttarakhand Forest Department to relocate us, a local, Sohan Singh Negi said. They have met with the forest department officials on numerous occasions regarding the same. But, till now, nothing has been done by the department even as everyday, the village is embroiled in some form of a man-animal conflict.",

The Project displaced thousands. While, the people affected by this Project are still fighting for their rights and this time with a remarkable difference—not for their individual land right, but for common property as the company has acquired 5.08 ha Van Panchayat: a system of autonomous village forest, unique to Uttarakhand, land in Urgam Van Panchayat, but has shrewdly shown it in Salna, a neighbouring van panchayat, outside the Project-affected area. But, the people of 13 villages spread in five Gram Panchayats: Urgam, Lyari, Thainga, Bhenta and Devgram, refuse to give in and are fighting to protect this common forest land from where they get their biomass like fuel and fodder and home-building wood logs. They are pursuing their fight at two levels: they are taking direct action by holding dharna (sit-ins) at District Magistrate’s, Company’s and Nandadevi National Park’s Sub-Divisional Commissioner’s offices. And, they are also submitting letter, memos and applications to these authorities, detailing facts and figures and appealing them to take appropriate action and compensate for the loss. Although the district administration has taking some action as it has written to the concerned authorities, especially to the company officials since it is a project in the public-private partnership, between NTPC and JPVL, but more than six of its letters have simply been ignored since 2016. But, people are determined to fight because they erected this mixed forest with their own labor and money that they got from MNREGA in 2015-16 when they roped thousands of broad-leaved species of oak, khirsu, Deodar, Tunand pear. They also built a khadanja (bridal-path), “This forest is crucial for our survival and we will fight to conserve it,” says Raj Rajeshwari Devi, ex-pradhan (ex-village head), Bhenta village, Chamoli district. Others are also equally determined, “Now, women don’t have to walk long distances to carry fuel and fodder and we will not let the company usurp it,” says a resolute Laxmi Devi, Urgam village.",

For the past two months, these families have been protesting in front of the Airport Authority of India (IAA) office in Jor Bagh, demanding the allotment of land they were promised as the compensation. The protest has been noticed by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). In a notice sent to the Delhi government, NHRC said the reports about the Dalit families struggling to get rehabilitation were “painful and indicative of grave violation of human rights of the aggrieved families”. The land of 63 acres, was acquired by the Airport Authority of India back in the 1972, when the High Court declared the authority must rehabilitate the entire village. According to the media report, carried on the 14th January, 2017, the families of the Dalits, evicted from their village due to the expansion of the Delhi Airport, have knocked the doors of almost every concerned authority in the Centre and the Government of NCT of Delhi but to no avail. They have been facing discrimination due to their caste. One such family, who re-allocated into another locality, was not allowed to cremate their dead as he was a Dalit from a different village. Expenditure on rented accommodation has put them on lot of financial burden in addition to other expenses related to the school fee of children etc. said the NHRC press release on January 23, 2017. NHRC issued notices to the Chief Secretary of the Delhi government and the chairperson of the Airports Authority of India, asking for reports within six weeks.

The villagers claim that no one cared to build a single road before to connect their villages, but now a new fancy road has been built for tourism purpose. The Forest Department argues that it is not their fault if the villagers have not claimed their FRA and that now after the creation of CTH as inviolate space, the FRA cannot be applied anymore to them because of the new CTH guidelines. Allegations are that in 2017 itself, the forest department set the Rantalodhi village on fire to forcefully relocate the village residents.",

Implementation of the project has been a long-standing demand of the people of Tumkuru and Ballari. It was undertaken on a cost-sharing basis between the Railways and the states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Land acquisition has been a problem in the Railway project mainly due to the issue of compensation. Since the quantum of land to be acquired from individual farmers is low, giving up land is not an issue at all. But compensation is indeed a major factor. The issue has not been resolved so far. In some cases, the process of acquisition is complete, but the agreed compensation has not been disbursed yet.",

The plant is one of the few projects in the Yamuna basin, where the government has identified a hydropower potential of 1,044.82 MW, to be shared between HP and Uttarakhand. The project is being executed by the HP Power Corporation Limited and is funded by the Asian Development Bank. Work on the project started in 2008 and is yet to be completed. The project was to be commissioned in 2012 with an investment of Rs 700 crore but is behind schedule and the investment requirement has doubled to almost Rs 1,200 crore. So far, up to 45 ha of private land has been acquired while 53 ha of forest land has been diverted.There are 12 Panchayats that will be directly or indirectly affected in varying degrees due to the project or project-related activities. At present, there is no strong mobilization of people opposing the project. However, those individuals and groups who have opposed the project have raised concerns about low compensation rates (a decision is now pending in the high court following an appeal filed by HPPCL), the impacts on local horticulture--especially on the profitable apple orchards, which form the backbone of the local economy--and the stability of the mountainous terrain. Due to the blasting for tunneling, houses and roads have developed cracks, which people are repairing at their own expense. Thana village, one of the villages above the tunnel, is particularly affected. Residents of Thana Plaun and Mandal villages approached the National Green Tribunal (NGT) with their plea against the project. NGT has ordered a site investigation.",

    "summary":"On March 24, the Bombay high court struck down a state government order acquiring a farmer's land in Targhar village, Panvel for a proposed International Airport project. The decision may impact the international airport coming up at Navi Mumbai, reported The Economist Times (ET). The Navi Mumbai International Airport is a Greenfield project proposed to be developed through Public Private Participation. The airport will cover 2,268 hectares in Panvel. City and Industrial Development Corporation of Maharashtra (CIDCO) is expected to finalise a bidder by April 2017. The Centre approved the project in 2007, but the delay in payment of compensation to the affected people has stalled the project. To rehabilitate the affected people of the villages in Panvel, CIDCO proposes to develop Pushpaknagar at the cost of Rs 563 crores. The total rehabilitation cost is estimated at Rs 1,869 crores. The project affected people demand 40 square meters of land, funds to construct a house post displacement, and a common place to build a temple. Entire Targhar village has been acquired for the airport. A portion of the runway and a fuel tank is to come-up on the land. Under the old land acquisition law, A farmer got Rs 54,000 INR for a land of 1,800 square Meter. If Cidco were to initiate fresh acquisition proceedings under the new Land Acquisition Act that came into force in 2013, the owner of land in a rural area would have to be paid twice the market rate plus 100% solatium (additional compensation as consolation), said Thakur. This could result in the compensation being four times the market price and could run into a few crores. In addition, 20% of developed land will have to be given to him in another location.",

The left front-led government came to terms with companies like Balaji groups and accumulated 1,897 acres for steel plantation. The state industrial development corporation initiated a project called 'industrial park project' in collaboration with companies like Adhunik Corporation Limited. The corporation acquired 793.75 acres for industrial park project I and 733.99 acres for industrial park project ll. Although most of the acquired land yields one seasonal harvest, the owners sold their lands to the government at a price way cheaper than the actual market value (Rs 2,000-2,200 per bigha). The government promised creation of job opportunities in large scales, luring the villagers to give away their land. But later the companies backed out. Even after TMC came to power, the demands have not been met. The landowners are now demanding their land back.",

    "summary":"In 2006, Jindal group proposed to set up a few industries in Salboni village in Medinipur district of West Bengal. These industries including a steel plant, thermal power plant, solar power plant and a cement plant were to come up on 4877 acres of land. Of this total land, 4200 acres were provided by the Animal Welfare Board of the state government. Jindal Group purchased 294 acres of land from the 485 farmers. In 2008, the government declared the area as special economic zone. Out of the 294 acres of land purchased from the farmers, about 100 acres belong to triabls. According to the 14B clause of the Land Revenue Act of 1955, tribal land cannot be transferred to a non-tribals. It is alleged that the company forcefully acquired this land from tribals. There was some forest land that was also taken for this project, but it is not clear how much. There are conflicting claims in the news reports. It is alleged that the forest land was taken without the consent of village councils, which is a violation of Firest Rights Act 2006. Farmers received a compensation of Rs. 3 lakhs per acre of land but land laborers were not taken into consideration. In 2014 December, Jindal Group chairman said that the company has put the Rs 35,000-crore project on “hold” over uncertainty of raw material linkages. Then in 2017, the company announced that they will require only 1,500 acres of land. It wants to return the remaining land to the state government. This has led to a conflict on the ground. JSW Bengal Steel Limited Land Losers Welfare Association's secretary Poriskar mahato said that that the company had promised to offer jobs to every land loser as part of rehabilitation package, but offered only 300 jobs that are contractual. The company is unable to give any job to the remaining 185 land losers. People demand that if the company is returning the land, the government will have to provide permanent jobs and compensation.",

In 2006 LDA proposed Vasant Kunj housing scheme on Sitapur-Hardoi bypass and invited bookings for plots spread across the planned three sectors of Vasant Kunj. The rate for booking the land was decided at 3000 per sqm. When the LDA started the process for acquiring the land from the farmers, they refused to give away their land and demanded twice the compensation that LDA was offering, which LDA denied. For the next two years, LDA kept trying to convince the farmers. But agitation had raged during the period, with the village residents - unhappy with the compensation offered - holding protests, blocking roads, stalling work at the site and even clashing with the LDA staff. When pressure started building up from the allotters’ side, the authority decided to cancel the registrations and planned to first settle the dispute with the famers. On one hand all the steps to convince the village residents were failing, on the other hand allotters also started building pressure on LDA to re-book the plots. Giving in to the pressure LDA tried to allot land to the people at a different location but this plan also failed owing to the lack of availability of land. With the dispute still unresolved, LDA is now planning a new housing scheme at the same location. According to the engineers of LDA, the matter with the farmers will soon be resolved.",

    "summary":"On the basis of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the TATA Power and the Odisha government for a 1000MW coal-based power plant at Naraj-Marthapur area in Cuttack district, at least 1200 acres of land was acquired by the Odisha Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (Idco), a state government agency, about a decade back. People living in five villages namely Mundali, Talagarh, Naraj-Marthapur, Ramdaspur and Nuagaon had lost agricultural land to the project. As the company faced strong opposition from the state forest and environment department and green activists over locating the plant close to Chandaka wildlife sanctuary on the outskirts of the state capital of Bhubaneswar, It changed the location first to Begunia in Khordha district and then decided to make it a shore-based plant at Gopalpur on the state's southern coast, where it already has acquired more than 3200 acres of land for a steel plant. But, finally, the company decided to shelve the project for reasons better known to the company. They have not submitted any formal proposal to put up a plant at Gopalpur. As of now, intent to set up any coal-based project by the company is not there,” according to Odisha's industry department sources. However, unfortunately, the land acquired in Naraj-Marthapur and adjacent villages for the initially proposed project has not been returned to people despite the fact they have remained unused for almost a decade. The one-time compensation paid by the company for their surrendered lands is no solace, say the affected people who are now battling for survival. With the formation of a protest banner named 'Sidheswar Anchalika Surakhya Committee,' People have started demanding the return of their lands while seeking the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to rescue them from the plight. Inspired by the Supreme Court judgement on land rights of farmers in Singur, We have decided to launch a democratic, peaceful and non-violent struggle to get back our land since the land is the only source of our livelihood, Subash C Sahoo, secretary of the committee noted in the letter to the Prime Minister. The committee has also alleged that the land was acquired forcefully from people and the public hearing was held at a distance of 20 km from the affected villages to ensure non-participation of most of the affected people.",

Village Baranj is located 2 km east of Bhadrawati taluka of Chandrapur District in Maharashtra where the company has got a coal block. The village has population of around 1286 households in three hamlets: Baranj Mokasa, Chak Baranj and Tanda. It has a mixed population of SC, ST, Notified Tribes and OBC. The village has been at loggerheads with the mining companies alleging “unjust” compensation for the land acquired from them and non-resettlement of the village for almost a decade. Coal Mining in Baranj Mokasa began nearly a decade ago when KECML was allotted a coal block here. The initial cost of the project was INR 5.24 billion and the production target was 2.4 MT coal per year. The project was to provide coal to a 1000 MW thermal power plant in Bellary, Karnataka. The proposed land to be acquired was 1664.26 hectare, out of which 1469.5 ha is private land, 108.33 ha is government land including a road, pond, grazing land and 86.42 ha forestland. The village residents allege that they have not been provided proper rehabilitation nor they have been given the promised jobs after their land was acquired. They say the jobs provided were contractual in nature with wages ranging from four to eight thousand per month. Some residents who got the job complained that they were being kept in “training period” for several months, thus full remunerations were not given. Till now only agricultural land has been acquired and the hamlets are left untouched. According to local activists, KECML is supposed to eventually resettle the whole village but no such proposal for resettlement has been put forward by the company yet. With no agricultural land, residents are struggling to earn livelihood.",

    "summary":"Vanxim is a remote estuarine island surrounded by the river Mandovi in central Goa. There are no bridges and one has to take two ferries to reach Vanxim. There are around 300 persons living there. The land is entirely owned by the Catholic church i.e. the Archdiocese and the residents are tenants. In 2006, the church sold around 6 lakh square metres (out of the total 8 lakh sq m) to a businessman Milind Gaunekar, who in turn executed agreements with a real estate developer, Ozone Leisure and Resorts Pvt Ltd, to develop this land as a private 'eco-tourism' resort. Some reports claim that they also proposed to build a golf course. This has divided the village. The village panchayat of Sao Mathias supports the project as they believe it will bring economic development and jobs to the village, while another group has objected to the impact this would have on life on the island, and have objected to alleged cutting of mangrove forests. Both groups have submitted memorandums to the Town and Country Planning department of Goa government. No work has begun. While land in Vanxim used to be under paddy cultivation, a breach in the 1990s caused saline water to settle on many farms. The breach was not repaired, and the farms are turning into mangrove forests. In Goa's regional land use plans, the paddy fields were reclassified in a later plan as land for 'hotels/resorts'. However, the entire plan was later denotified. In December 2015, the Goa government declared the area in Vanxim as an 'Investment Promotion Area' under a new law to provide single-window land clearance for businesses. Such Areas are exempt from all town planning rules and outside the village panchayat's control. The Bombay High Court has issued notices to the state government on Investment Promotion Areas, including Vanxim, on a plea that they are unconstitutional and would affect eco-sensitive areas.",

    "summary":"The Tiracol golf course and resort project was proposed by Leading Hotels Pvt Ltd, a subsidiary of Four Seasons Hotels group, in Tiracol village, Pernem taluka, North Goa. Tiracol is spread over 13.85 lakh square metres. The project proposed to purchase and develop 12.18 lakh square metres, which is nearly all of the housing and agricultural land of the village, leaving out just the Tiracol Fort, a protected heritage structure. There are 300 residents in Tiracol. Most of the village is under cashew plantation and some seasonal cultivation. The village land is owned by one Kashinath Surendra Xete Colopo alias Kashinath Surendra Khalap. All villagers are tenants. The conflict lies in this structure of land ownership and control. The Khalap family sold the land to Leading Hotels. However, under the tenancy reforms carried out in Goa since the end of Portuguese rule in 1961, tenants have been given land titles and protection from eviction. Also, the tenanted agricultural land cannot be used for other purposes. Leading Hotels has maintained that there are no tenants on the land it bought from the landlord. The villagers refute this. They allege that after purchasing the land from the Khalaps in November 2007, Leading Hotels began coercing tenants into signing so-called ‘negative declarations’ - that they are not tenants and have not cultivated the land. People don't want to vacate the land at all. Their cashew plantations are lucrative and hard to be replace in alternative sites.Project opponents organised under the St Anthony’s Tenants and Mundkars Association sued Leading Hotels and the Goa Government in the Bombay High Court in December 2014, alleging fraudulent conversion of tenanted agricultural land. The court has since stayed the project and is hearing the matter. The villagers also challenged the environment clearance and coastal regulation zone clearance accorded to the project in December 2014. In May 2015, when the hearings in the National Green Tribunal case were briefly stayed by the Bombay High Court on a technical argument, Leading Hotels attempted to restart project work. When the villagers went to protest at the site, they entered into scuffles with Leading Hotel workers, including security personnel, and many were hurt. This event put the Tiracol conflict in the limelight, and brought public sympathy in favour of the tenants. Several protests against the golf course were held across Goa. Tiracol residents are assisted by the NGO Goa Foundation in all legal matters. A fact-finding committee was set up by the government under bureaucrat Sandeep Jacques to establish if the land was tenanted or under cultivation. Jacques submitted the report in December 2015 but the government did not disclose the report until much later. Although the report points at several irregularities, it is inconclusive and asks for a full-fledged judicial inquiry. The NGT on 29 November 2016 passed a judgement keeping the Environment Clearance of the project in abeyance and the state environment appraisal committee to reconsider it. The committee's verdict is awaited.",

People from the upper caste Kamma community had allegedly taken some of that land fraudulently and some at throwaway prices. The minster and his followers started cultivating Sababul crop. But in 2006 the government stripped them of their land under AP Assigned Land (Prohibition of Transfers) Act that says that the lands assigned to Dalits cannot be sold or bought. Since 2006 to 2014, the land was empty. Dailt families worked as agriculture labourers in nearby villages during that period. When Dalits occupied the lands in 2014 by plotting red flags after a prolonged political movement, the minister and his followers are again using their political clout to get these lands into their name.

This will only aggravate the present situation and more villages will be flooded. The Govt. is using this strategy to create fear amongst the displaced people that water will be released at any cost and they have to move out. On the other hand, many of them still are yet to receive compensation or the benefits promised earlier. Even the houses are not completed in the R&R colonies.",

    "summary":"In 2006, cement giants Ultratech Cement, Shree Cement, India Cements came to limestone-rich Nawalgarh, in Jhunjhunu, to set up plants. Limestone is the prime ingredient for cement production. The state government declared 5,769 hectares as land of “little agricultural importance”, and notified it for the plants and ancillary mines. It granted over 4,600 ha to Ultratech Cement of Aditya Birla Group, 780 ha to Shree Cement of Rajasthan and 825 ha to India Cements of Chennai. Ninety per cent of the notified area is, reportedly, private-owned. So, about 15,000 farmers across 21 villages stand to lose their land. They protest against the acquisition. Lately, people of the neighbouring villages have also joined the protest. They are apprehensive of the effect the cement plants can have on the environment, especially groundwater. The conflict is not for compensation. The government has already announced the compensation amount—Rs 18 lakh for one hectare of irrigated land and Rs 17 lakh for one hectare of unirrigated or rain-fed land. The landowners are protesting the acquisition of their fertile land which gives them three crops a year. They also accuse the government of taking a decision without consulting the people and without following the procedure of land acquisition transparently. The government claims public consultations were held and notifications were issued in local dailies. Residents trash the claim. The acquisition was made for Shree Cement, which had requested the Rajasthan State Industrial Development and Investment Corporation (RIICO) to acquire land for its plant. It is reported that one of the three companies has given up the idea of setting up a cement plant here, while another is still to obtain technical approval from RIICO. Despite the protest, the company is buying land directly from farmers for its mine. There have been incidences of rules violations. The Rajasthan Land Tenancy Act prohibits buying land of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes, but it is reported that the companies are buying land in the name of their agents and employees. This indicates the inherent weakness of Land Acquisition Act 2013 in addressing the concerns of the farmers.",

Northern Karnataka and the bordering areas of Maharashtra and Goa depend on the Mahadayi river basin for all their water needs. In 2006, Maharashtra began constructing the Virdi Dam. But the state neither followed the required environmental norms, nor did it inform the Goa government about it. Under the Virdi Large Minor Irrigation Project, Maharashtra’s proposal is for irrigation, drinking water, industrial, hydropower and other uses within the Mhadei basin. Maharashtra has also proposed diversion of 80 million cubic metres (2.83 TMC) of water of the Mhadei basin to the adjoining Tillari basin for meeting its outside basin irrigation needs. In June 2015, Goa filed a petition with the Water Disputes Tribunal against the Maharashtra government, as it fears discrepancy in water distribution and ecological loss to the Western Ghats. In May 2015, Maharashtra had given an undertaking to the Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal that it will not commence work on the gorge portion. But residents of Goa allege that the work is in progress. On September 8, 2016, the Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal, headed by Justice J M Panchal, suggested that the chief ministers of Karnataka, Goa and Maharashtra should arrive at an amicable settlement to the dispute.

The new company will extract coal from the Mahan block of Singrauli fields in Madhya Pradesh, and supply it to the proposed power plants of Essar and Hindalco. Essar Power has invested Rs 4,000 crore for a 1,000-megawatt power project, while Hindalco is setting up a 750-megawatt captive power plant and has invested Rs 2,400 crore in it. The mine has proven coal reserve of 150 million tonnes. Companies, mostly thermal power plants, are in a rush to acquire land here. Mahan Coalfields Limited wants 1,000 hectares forest land, which falls under the environment ministry’s ‘No-go’ Zone. In fact, it is one of Asia’s oldest Sal forests. The forest is a source of livelihood for the communities living there. The people earn by collecting forest produce such as mahua and tendu leaves. They do not want the Mahan forest to be dug up for coal, and have come together under the banner of Mahan Sangharsh Samiti. Residents allege company officials intimidate them. Others say their signatures have been forged to show approval for Mahan Coal Limited’s plan. They have submitted a memorandum at the district collector’s office stating that their rights have been violated.",

    "summary":"For the tribesmen of Attappady in Kerala’s Palakkad district, 31 wind turbines symbolise exploitation. Attappady is home to 6,000 tribal families in 180 hamlets scattered over 745 sq km in three panchayats. In 2007, Pune-based Sarjan Realities started taking on lease adivasi land located in the Nilgiris Biosphere Reserve. The firm set up 31 windmills on 623 acres, mostly on Sholayoor and Agali panchayats for the multinational, Suzlon Energy Ltd. The turbines had a combined capacity of 20MW. The windmills were sanctioned by the Agency for Non-conventional Energy and Rural Technology.   When inaugurated in 2007, Suzlon announced that power generated would cater to Attappady’s requirement of 0.5 MW, and the rest would be transmitted to the other parts of Palakkad. Incidentally, Kerala’s Tribal Land Act, 1975, mandates that tribal land can only be sold to other tribals, that too under unavoidable circumstances. The Supreme Court had asked the government to cancel all transactions after 1986, but the order was circumvented by forcing tribesmen to part with their land. On August 8, 2010, the then district collector K. V. Mohan sought the details of all land deals in six Attappady since January 2006. Earlier, the collector had recommended the government to conduct a detailed inquiry into the land deals by Sarjan Realities. In a May 17, 2010 report, Attappady's Integrated Tribal Development Project (ITDP) officer stated that Suzlon was buying and encroaching upon tribal land to lay roads. The officer also mentioned that more than 60 hectares (ha), where the company has put up 12 windmills, belonged to 36 tribesmen who were paying tax for the land. While Sarjan Realities claimed that the 261 ha it had bought was from non-tribals, the ITDP report detailed the tribal land it had bought. The tribesmen were misled into believing that they were giving their land on lease. Some of them got Rs 12,000 for land. They thought the land would be utilised for widening the panchayat roads, the report said. In 2011, the Kerala High Court stayed the government decision to takeover about 85.21 acres of tribal land occupied by Suzlon, which said the resumption of tribal land has to be done in accordance with the provisions of 1999 Act. But the takeover was based on the recommendations of a government-appointed high-power committee. Earlier in 2011, the Oommen Chandy-led government had promised to give a portion of Suzlon’s profit to the tribals on whose land it had set up windmills. But the plan was changed when the ministry decided to return 85 acres encroached by the multinational firm. A vigilance probe later, the project was called off after 31 windmills had been set up. They were later sold to private business houses in the state. According to an agreement between the state government and National Hydro Power Corporation in 2014, it was proposed 82 MW of wind power would be generated in Attappady in stages. Though a profit-sharing plan was mooted, it came under severe criticism. When asked about the profit-sharing plan, M. Sukumaran of Attappady Samrakshana Samithi (Attappady Protection Council) said if implemented, it would amount to agreeing that the land was legally taken over. The council wants the land to be returned, and its focus is only around the land where seven windmills are installed. Sukumaran said each of these seven windmills stand on one acre and 20 cents, taken over using fake documents. Palakkad will soon have the state’s largest wind energy project once the 22 MW Inox Wind Farm is commissioned at the Kinfra Industrial Park in Kanjikode. Its trial run was successfully completed and 100 units of power were generated. The tribesmen, meanwhile, are not sure if they would benefit from the project. The adivasi protection council, too, is confused and has hit a deadend. It feels it won’t get relief from the government.",

    "summary":"Kalinganagar, under Sukinda and Danagadi blocks of Jajpur district of Orissa, is the new industrial hub of the state. The area has a significant tribal and dalit population. People belonging to the Ho community constitute nearly 80% of the tribal population and the rest belong to the Munda and Santal communities. On 2nd January 2006, the state police had resorted to firing on a mass of tribal protesters who were protesting against the construction work of a proposed steel plant by the Tatas at Kalinganagar. At least 13 tribals and one policeman was killed and some were injured. On 2nd January 2016, tribals of the region celebrated Martyrs’ day and commemorated 10 years of the firing incident at Kalinga nagar. They said that the residents of the region were still protesting against take over of their land by the company. Meanwhile, a three member judicial commission of inquiry set up by the State government for investigating the incident on 2nd January 2006 is stuck midway without any conclusion. The members of the coalition which is spearheading the protest said that though the steel company rehabilitated the displaced tribals in the colony, it has overlooked their problems and has been neglecting them since then.They have alleged that over 307 families rehabilitated in Gobarghati Colony since 2007 have been deprived of assistance under various government welfare schemes as they are yet to get land pattas. In September 2016, villagers of Baligotha, ( Chandia Mouza) and Kalinga nagar, submitted a petition to the Revenue Divisional Commissioner (RDC) , Central Division at Cuttack against the illegal construction of a boundary wall for the TATA steel plant in the midst of a Sal forest. The petition argues the construction of the wall will have impending threat to the wildlife and the medicinal plants in the region. Villagers have also moved the National Green Tribunal arguing that they have been living for generations on the forest land and depend on forest for their livelihood and demanding that the boundary wall should not be constructed. They are protesting against the setting up of a boundary wall for the plant as resettlement and rehabilitation issue is far from resolved.The case is continuing in the NGT.",

After a memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed in 2005, the Chhattisgarh State Industrial Development Corporation acquired land from the farmers of 10 villages. As many as 542 farmers refused to give up their land and accept compensation. They complained that in the past promises made in lieu of land acquisition were not kept. People were not rehabilitated properly. The promised jobs, drought relief measures, fertlizers and seeds never came their way. This apart, the farmers were unable to sell their produce to cooperative societies and could not take the benefit of agricultural schemes, as they no longer owned their land. On the other hand, Tata Steel did not develop the proposed plant for over a decade. In 2015, the state government cancelled its licence. The issue was raised by the Opposition in the State Assembly in March 2016. Finally, in August 2016, Tata Steel announced its withdrawal from Lohandiguda citing law and order problems due to the presence of Naxalites in the region. Tata Steel has sought refund of the Rs 72.09 crores it paid to the state government as advance. Despite Tata Steel’s withdrawal, chances of farmers getting their land back is bleak. The state government has refused to return the land. It wants to create a land bank and give it to companies that wish to do business there. In September 2016, advocate Sudiep Shrivastava filed a petition demanding that land acquisition be quashed and the land be returned to farmers. He said that all new land acquisitions in the region should start afresh on current rates.",

The conflict started immediately after the announcement in the proposed plant site in Jagatsinghpur. About 700 families of three gram panchayats were at risk of losing their livelihood. This area is also known for its rich soil where most people earn by cultivating betel vines, paddy, vegetables and do fishing. The project got its first environmental clearance in 2007 and the statutory forest clearance in 2010. On July 28, 2010, the then union environment minister set up a committee to examine the validity of the clearance following several petitions to ministry accusing POSCO of violations of all kinds. The project got clearance with additional conditions. Unhappy villagers accused POSCO of violating Forest Rights Act. Later, the National Green Tribunal suspended the clearance. All of this lead to POSCO withdrawing the project. People demand that the 2,700 acres should be returned to them. But, Odisha Industrial Development Corporation (IDCO) had other plans. A few week ago IDCO started building walls around the 2700 acres of land to protect it from the encroacers and establishment of some new industry. This incensed the people. Demonstration were staged at the site of wall construction in Nuagaon village, which led to the temporarily halt of the construction, but it was resumed soon. Two platoons of force were deployed to prevent law and order situation. Locals have changed the stretegy after the deployment of police-- they are going to fight against the wall leagally.",

The administration has constituted a team under Tehsildar of the region to bring down the encroachment and give possession of land to the allottees. Some allottees have appealed in the high court. The court had ordered the authority in 2013 to provide possessions, but LDA couldn’t get them vacated. The high court made a task force but in vain. The allottees are still waiting for the possession. The villagers argue that LDA hasn’t yet acquired the land. LDA serves the notice, but we won’t vacate the lands until we are compensated.

    "summary":"Udanti-sitanadi wildlife sanctuary was declared a Tiger Reserve under project tiger in 2009. The process of declaring the sanctuary as tiger reserve started in early 2004. During this process, Forest Department did not allow residents of villages in the core zone of the reserve to collect minor forest produce. The department asked them to leave the forest and settle somewhere else with a resettlement package under project tiger.Many tribal women were allegedly framed under false charges for collecting firewood from the forest area. Residents of these villages were already aware of the condition of those who were relocated, so they started to refuse to relocate and asserted their rights over forest. Residents of 17 villages organized themselves to start the movement for their rights, and went till Delhi. This happened before Forest Rights Act of 2006 was passed. Forest Rights Act empowered them to continue the movement. They submitted applications to the local administration offices to claim their individual and community forest rights. However, only Individual Forest Rights have been recognised for them but no community rights. Community rights are important because they allow communities to not just farm but also collect non-timber produce and do other activities like fishing and cattle grazing. Despite repeated demands of these people, river bridges and roads also have not been built by the administration. The gram sabha’s of these villages have given many applications to the Sub-divisional megistrate and the chief minister about these issues but haven't heard anything back. That led residents of these 17 villages decide to not let forest department do any kind of plantation activity in their forest area, and have taken the control in their hands to manage the forest. They have formed the Community Forest Management Committee through which they plan to manage their land, and plan to grow bamboo and other trees that give minor forest produce like mahua flower and tendu leaves which they can sell. Recently, residents of these villages protested on the NH 130 C to demand community forest rights and other facilities that have not been given to them yet. Instead of listening to them, the forest department continues to threaten them to relocate.",

Here, women have scripted a story of struggle by taking over land, which they claim is traditionally theirs. In 2004, the women of Darma village tilled some 200 hectares overnight to claim their land. Darma is in the foothills of the Vindhyas, near Kaimur, a village of tribals. Over the years, people have reclaimed more than 8,000 hectares of forestland in Kaimur region under the banner of Kaimur Kshetra Mahila Mazdoor Kisaan Sangharsh Samiti. They challenge the “historical injustice” of land distribution and the control of land mafia on large tracts of forestland in the region. In 2006, the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers Act, (Recognition of Forest rights) was passed which ensures land rights of traditional forest-dwellers on disputed forestland. All India Union of Forest Working People is spearheading the tribals’ cause using the slogan “Jo zameen sarkari hai, woh zameen hamari hai”. The government is resisting the assertion of the people.

    "summary":"In the year 2013, two villages Rajanacha and Baijadhap primarily inhabited by Baiga tribespeople near the Bhoramdeo Wildlife sanctuary were razed down by Chhattisgarh Forest Department. The department believed that they posed threat to wildlife. Around 60 families became homeless in one day. Baigas have been displaced multiple times in this region to make way for Bauxite mining by Vedanta in the year 2003, and then for tiger corridor. Each time without settling their forest and land rights under the Forest Rights Act of (FRA) 2006. This is a violation of their rights protected under FRA. When media and activists approached Forest Department about Baigas eviction, the department justified its action by saying that it was done to protect tigers. However, the department has also accepted that threat from the national highway and mining activities around the reserve is more threatening for tigers than Baigas. The evicted Baiga families are now living on the fringes of the reserve and working as a daily wage earner in nearby vedanta mines and kawardha district as they dont have land to do farming. They are also restricted from entering the forest on which they depended to earn their livelihood. Baigas demand settlement of their land and forest rights under FRA. They are unhappy but haven't protested for the fear of forest department. Some of them have spoken to local media to get their voices out.",

Environmental impact assessment or public consultation has not been done for the project. Local sources allege that the communities were told that the project is an expansion of existing harbor. Most of the protest was from local residents, especially fishermen and supported by other Kerala-based people's and environmental organizations. In 2016, residents and local environmental organizations further intensified protests and cordoned the area in an attempt to stop mining equipment and vehicles from entering. The mining stopped in June 2017, presumably due to the expiry of license, and protests were stopped, but locals are worried that operations may resume if their license is renewed.",

    "summary":"In recent years, the Jammu & Kashmir government has been trying to convince the army to vacate 139 acres of land which it is occupying in Batamaloo area of Srinagar (Toto Ground), the heart of the city. However, there has been no breakthrough so far as the army is allegedly dilly-dallying even as it has been provided with 100 acres of land at an alternate place. Since 2003, successive governments have been urging the army to vacate the land and allow the government to use that space for creating some open space in the city which has witnessing massive urbanisation over the past few decades. According to a study carried out by researchers of Kashmir University’s department of Geography, the city has grown 12 times in terms of population and 23 times in terms of area between 1901 and 2011. Another report in 2011, said that Srinagar city is one of the 100 fastest growing urban areas in the world. The occupation of prime public land in the heart of the Srinagar city by the army, has aggrieved the local population. Locals say that it is a source of discomfort for the people of the region as it not only hinders the free movement of people but has also made it impossible for the civilian population to raise any infrastructure for the public use on the state land. The government has been planning to establish a huge public recreational park in the area apart from using a segment of this land for the extension of a bus terminus.If the army vacates this land, it can be used for public good. The government in Srinagar is already facing scarcity of land and feels compelled to built important infrastructure such as hospitals and disaster-prone sites like flood basins which often get inundated by floods, said Noor Mohammad, a businessman in Batamaloo.",

    "summary":"Displaced families of Rajmahal Coal Project, a unit of Eastern Coalfield Limited are accusing the mining giant of incomplete rehabilitation and resettlement. The project site is Lalmatia at Godda district in Jharkhand. Residents of Bhoda Tola Bhoria Village claim that they were displaced around a decade back and shifted to the present location. However, the coal mines are barely 25 meters away from the village. Village residents say that continuous blasting to extract the coal has made their life difficult and prone to risk. The walls of their houses have developed crack and they are forced to live under continuous fear. Village residents also accuse that the company has been assuring an alternate place for rehabilitation but not much progress have been made. The rehabilitation site near Lohandia Bustee is being developed for the last two-and-a-half years. The work has still not been completed. Angry residents recalled that company had promised electricity, pond, medical facilities after the displacement but none of them have been fulfilled. Local Member of the Legislative Assembly, from the ruling Bhartiya Janta Party, Tala Marandi met the displaced families of the coal project and assured the families of proper compensation. According to ECL, around 1564 families have been rehabilitated from Lamatia, Dakaita and Ishwar Marandi Nagar. Around six tolas of Bara Bhoria bustee need proper rehabilitation and need 114.79 acres of land. Company has deposited a sum of Rs 60 lakh to Jharkhand government for land based compensation to the villagers. Opencast coal mining under Rajmahal Project was started in 2003 at an investment of Rs 2078 crores. Tala Marandi told landconflictwatch.org that the village residents are very angry. He pointed out that displaced people are living under extreme mental anxiety because of the continuous blasts that shakes their houses. Company and district administration has not implemented the rehabilitation promises completely. “A meeting with the district administration would be held soon. Company has deposited compensation and other amounts to the government. Now, mostly it’s a matter of monitoring and ensuring that villagers get their rights,” Marandi added. ECL authorities maintained that the Resettlement and Rehabilitation money was deposited with the district administration. In case, district administration directs us of any discrepancies or shortcomings, we will immediately look into the matter.",

    "summary":"The government of Odisha granted a mining lease to the Aditya-Birla-group-owned Hindalco, the aluminum manufacturing company in the Mali Parbat in 2003. The project is spread over 270 acres near Dolitoamba, about 20 km from Semiliguda in south Odisha's Koraput district. The company obtained the lease for 20 years with mining capacity of 6 lakh tonnes Bauxite per annum. Around 44 villages under the Sorishapodar, Hundi, Dalaiguda and Pakhajhola panchayats in Similiguda block would be affected by the mining. In the year 2003, the tribals organised themselves and formed a coalition to oppose the mining. Villagers claimed that as the mining site falls in the areas listed under the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution, the mining company would require the consent of the Gram Sabhas (village assemblies) for the diversion of land. In such areas, Gram Sabhas enjoy special privileges to protect the rights of tribals as per the Panchayat Raj Extension to Schedule Areas (PESA) Act, 1996. The legal requirement has been affirmed by the Forest Rights Act of 2006 and by the Supreme Court in its judgment in the Niyamagiri Hills mining case in 2013. Environmentalist and villagers claimed that the water sources in the area, used by villagers for irrigation to raise their vegetables, will disappear if bauxite mining continued. They feared It will force them to move away from their ancestral land and look out for other livelihood option. There are 32 perennial streams and four canals that emerge from this hill. Nearly 2,500 families living in 44 villages rely on this water for irrigation of their fields. The mine stopped operation in 2010 due to the stiff opposition from the locals. Though bauxite excavation resumed for a brief period in 2012, it had to be halted as protesters opposed transportation of the mineral. On January 10, 2014, more than one thousand people from 44 villages staged a Dharna to protest against the mining activities. The administration reacted by imposing Section 144 (preventing assembly of more than three people at a notified place) of CRPC in the area. During the conflict, many activists have faced the wrath of the police, administration, and local goons. Many have been implicated in false cases. However, the coalition of tribals is resolute that they will not let the mining start in the region. On January 18, 2017, over 4000 adivasis organised a rally to oppose the mining.",

    "summary":"As an aftermath of the Supreme Court's decision to allow environmental clearances of both the alumina refinery and the mining plant, the Dongaria kondh tribe protested the decision. Serious human rights violations were reported. The Forest Rights Act (FRA) also came to the rescue of the Dongarias. The Government of India sent experts such as Dr NC Saxena and Dr Usha Swaminnnathan on fact-finding missions. They all reported gross violations of laws and rights by the company Vedanta, in which state agencies are also a party. The Union environment ministry cancelled all permissions granted to the company. Following the setback, the Odisha government, through the state-owned company Odisha Mining Corporation (OMC), petitioned the Supreme Court to reverse the mining ban on Vedanta and allow the sixfold expansion the of the alumina refinery. With the court's ruling constantly being postponed, Niyamgiri witnessed a showdown between Vedanta and the organized mass-scale protests by the tribals. Public meetings were often held in the villages of Niyamgiri, where the residents were made aware of the dangers of mining and the threat of eviction. In its order of April 18, 2013, the court recognized that the Dondria Kondh's right to worship their sacred mountain must be protected and that those with religious and cultural rights must be heard in the decision-making process as per the Forest Rights Act. Twelve gram sabhas (village councils) were chosen by the state to make this crucial decision. All of them unanimously voted against the project. In January 2014, the Union ministry of environment and forests rejected all clearances granted to the Vedanta project. The latest attack on tribal rights is an interlocutory application filed by the Odisha government before the Supreme Court on February 25, 2016. The application has been moved by OMC. The application claims the FRA does not require any consent from the gram sabhas for the use of forest land if the state decides that the rights of people have been settled. It has also questioned the resolutions of the 12 gram sabhas on the basis of technical errors committed during the passage of the resolutions rejecting mining. The apex court on May 6, 2016, upheld its earlier judgement by rejecting the state government/OMC petition. However, there are reports of clashes between the tribals and the authorities/security forces, which have evoked fear among tribals that the government may not give up mining of Niyamgiri.",

    "summary":"The Omkareshwar Dam is a gravity dam on the Narmada River just upstream of Mandhata in Khandwa district, Madhya Pradesh, India. The dam was constructed between 2003 and 2007 with the purpose of providing water for irrigation of 132,500 ha (327,000 acres). An associated hydroelectric power station located at the base of the dam has an installed capacity of 520 MW. The Omkareshwar Project was conceived in 1965 as an irrigation and power dam to be built in the Central Indian State of Madhya Pradesh. A Detailed Project Report (DPR) was put forward in 1983, but as construction was delayed time and again, both design and budget have changed significantly over time. The Rs 3539 crore project entails the construction of a 73 meter high concrete gravity dam on the Narmada River about 1 km upstream of Mandhata Island, where the famous temple town of Omkareshwar is situated. At full reservoir level, the project will submerge 93 sq km including up to 5800 ha of forest lands and some 30 villages in the Khandwa and Dewas Districts of Madhya Pradesh. The dam is envisaged to provide upto 520 MW of electricity and will supposedly irrigate 147,000 hectars. The Jal Satyagraha began after the government raised the water level of the Omkareshwar Dam from 189 metres to 191 metres, which multiplied the troubles of the affected people as their places got submerged in water. A group of farmers near Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh, who were protesting by standing in waist-deep waters of the Narmada river for 32 days seeking rehabilitation after being displaced by construction of the Omkareshwar Dam, called off their Jal Satyagraha. However, people are resisting the project.",

These villages are-- Balarpur, Gatwaya, Lakhangawan, Harnagar, Chak Kamalpur, Mauakheda, Arjungawan, Mamoni, Dongar and Chak Dongar. The relocation began in 2002 when Balarpur was relocated near the periphery of the mark. But the land allotted to the families, most of them from Saharia tribe, was infertile. About 40 families have not yet received their share of land. Other villages were surveyed in 2004 but were given compensation only in 2008-09. All these villages were neither duly informed about displacement nor their consent was taken for relocation. The forest officials allegedly coerced some people to leave the village but faced resistance from many residents who do not want to leave. In response, the forest department has deprived them of basic facilities like electricity, roads and every other developmental works. Reportedly, forest officials also confiscate cattle of villagers when cattle is found grazing in the forest. The department release them after villagers pay a fine. The evicted Sahariyas of Balarpur are not allowed to collect firewood, tendu leaves and other minor forest produce from the forests and they are living in the relocated site in abject poverty. The residents of other villages have made several representations to District Collector and Chief Minister but in vain. They don't want to be relocated. Recently, the villagers, launched a frest protest with the help of Zenith Legal Services Clinic led by a group of law students. They demand that the relocation be stopped and their land and forest rights should be settled under the Forest Rights Act. It is mostly the Sahariyas, small and marginal farmers from the nine villages who are protesting. In response to the protest the district collector said that he will look into the matter but nothing has happened yet.",

    "summary":"Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) came up with the Mansarovar Housing scheme in November 2002. The project included residential and commercial plots along with houses for economically weaker sections. Thousands of applications were filed to book the plots. Almost all the plot/house allottees have also deposited fee and had gotten their sale deeds. When allottees awaiting the possession over their plots/houses filed a query against the delay, LDA told them that the project land has fallen into a conflict with the defense department. Defense personnel claimed that 3.9 acres of the land involved in the project belonged to the department. Incensed by LDA's delay and insensitivity towards them, allottees approached the court. In 2014, Allahabad High Court ordered the LDA to either refund the money of the allottees with the interest or give them plots in some other project. Owing to its apathy towards allottees neither did LDA refund the money nor did it provide the houses in some different location for a really long time. Recently, LDA proposed that allottees can choose to take plots/houses in a different housing scheme nearby along with a few conditions. It further added fuel to the fire. Allottees complained that optional plots/houses that LDA is providing them are very costly. The tussle between LDA and allottees is far from being resolved.",

It wanted to recover about 400 ha of land in the sanctuary from these families. The sanctuary is spread in an area of 344.444 square kilometres in the Muthanga, Kurichiat, Tholpetty, and Sulthan Bathery forest ranges. About 3000 to 3500 families, including tribals live here. Most of these families have forestland possession certificates called ‘Kaivasa Rekha’ given to them by the government in 1940s-50s. A compensation of Rs 1 lakh (INR 0.1 million) or one acre of land was decided to be given to each family for relocation. during the period. Between 2008 and 2013, a total 185 tribal families were relocated from the sanctuary with this compensation. Later the government revised the compensation scheme offering Rs 10 lakhs to each family for relocation. In June 27, 2013 40 families from the Kottamkara hamlet were relocated under this scheme. However, with this, the families who were relocated earlier also started demanding Rs 10 lakh each which the forest department refused to pay. The families set to be relocated also started alleging that the forest department had not been considering adult sons as separate families eligible for compensation. Some of the relocated families have come back to the sanctuary and have started living their again alleging of they haven't received the promised money. Recently the state forest minister said the relocation was being hindered due to fund crunch and requested money from the State Scheduled Tribes Development Department and the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests. However, most of the families in the sanctuary are now demanding recognition of their rights over forestland under the Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006 and have refused to lave the land. The implementation of FRA is under process.",

    "summary":"Soon after Guwahati became the new state capital in 1972 (Shillong was the former one), it witnessed a huge expansion. Several new administrative government jobs were generated, and the informal sector started booming. Poor growth in agricultural sector and annual devastating floods and land erosion pushed a large number people to move to Guwahati in search of jobs. The city expanded from the market areas of Fancy Bazar, Athgaon, Pan Bazar, Paltan Bazar and Uzan Bazar to adjoining rural areas. After the liberalization of economy, Guwahati witnessed another phase of expansion. Corporate and business classes emerged in the city, so did new roads, buildings and other infrastructure. Owing to the huge influx of people, the city started suffering acute shortage of housing. According to reports, land in hills and wetlands were illegally occupied by businessmen and government officials. In many cases, government reportedly gave land to public and private institutions. According to a survey by AC Nielsen in 2009, around 65,900 households were residing in 16 hill settlements. Some 71 percent of all households were living on government land, while around 18 percent were living on land that was part of reserve forest. About 7.3 percent households were located on patta land owned by others, while around 3.6 percent households were living on patta land under their ownership. People living in hills and wetlands in Guwahati started demanding land patta from the government. Despite the demonstration, government initiated eviction drive in 2002 and displaced thousands of people from hills. Local organizations Krishak Mukti Sangam Samity and Unnayan Samity continued to protest. Government formed a committee to look into the matter under the leadership of the then revenue minister Bhumidhar Barman but nothing concrete happened. In 2014, another round of eviction drive started and saw widespread protests by people. In a protest march, at least three people were killed in police firing, including a minor. In another incident, a person self immolated in front of the state secretariat. Nothing much happened the next two years. But the present government has again sent notice to the hill dwellers and asked them to vacate the encroached land.",

Many of the plots are falling on graveyards, ponds, and parts of the land where slums are located. Mansarovar Yojna, situated on the Kanpur Road has 46 plots falling on designated ponds. Half of the allottees have already got their registries done. Whent the allottees started protesting LDA informed them that it is preparing the land use map again, and the allotments will be redone according to the new map, after it is approved. The case is pending before the court. In Vasant Kunj township project located on Hardoi Road, more than 1,000 people have been allotted land but LDA never got the land use changed. The project has already been delayed by more than a decade, and now LDA is saying that it will hand over the plots after the land use change is done. The process of land use change is stuck at the office of the land planning department. People are running from office to office to get the possession. More than 100 allottees could net get their possession because LDA allotted them plots on the same land where slum-dwellers have been living illegally for a really long time. None of the allottees could get their plots registered on the land due to the opposition from the slum-dwellers. In Gomti Nagar, LDA allotted many plots on the common land falling under Gram Sabha's control. Many of these plots are falling on 'Eidgaah' and 'Graveyard'. People could not get their plots because of the opposition from the villagers. Allottees are alleging that LDA does not seem very active in dealing with the situation.",

    "summary":"The Renuka dam project has been conceived as a drinking water supply scheme for the National Capital Territory of Delhi and envisages the construction of 148 m high rock-fill dam on the Giri river (a tributary of the Yamuna) at Dadahu in Sirmaur district of Himachal Pradesh (HP). A powerhouse will be built at the toe of the dam. The project was scheduled for completion by November 2014. The project construction was stayed by National Green Tribunal in 2010-11 following objections to the environment clearance granted to the project. The project cost has shot up from Rs 3,572.19 crore to Rs 5,000 crore over the past few years. The project plan dates back to May 1994 when the governments of Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan signed a memorandum of understanding for utilising and allocation of the waters of the upper reaches of the Yamuna river, which included the Renuka storage dam to be constructed in Sirmour district. The MoU says that the state agency, HP Power Corporation Ltd , will construct, operate and maintain the project while Centre will fund it. The total agricultural land to be diverted for this project is 1,231 hectares, belonging to 32 villages. The dam and its reservoir will submerge 909 ha of reserved forestland, including 49 ha of the Renuka Wildlife Sanctuary. The final forest clearance for the project is yet to be granted. The Forest Rights Act 2006 remains unimplemented in the area. The environment clearance was challenged by local residents in the National Green Tribunal. The NGT, while upholding the clearance, directed a joint inspection team to look into grievances relating to land acquisition and rehabilitation. In July 2016, the team visited the affected area. Reports say the team stressed the rehabilitation plan should ensure all affected people should be rehabilitated in a time-bound manner before commissioning the project. But after acquiring the land the state government has not paid compensation to the farmers. The Supreme Court, in August, 2016, directed the Centre to pay Rs 450 crore to the state in a week’s time towards compensation for the land acquired for the Renuka Dam and also consider waiving Rs 1,090 crore meant for forest clearance in the second stage.",

    "summary":"Several fisherfolks living in Maxem (also spelt Mashem) village in South Goa are opposing road construction works in their area. The road is a bypass to the National Highway-66 (old NH17) and includes a small bridge over the Maxem river and a long embankment along the river bank. The latter entails landfilling on the banks up to 3 metres in width and 5 metres in height. The land-filling took place as early as the year 2000, and the fisherfolks have been fighting against it with the state public works department ever since. Fisherfolks' houses are built along the banks where a huge mud wall has been built, due to which they have lost direct access to the river. The river is not far from the sea and the houses have become flood-prone as there is no way for rainwater to drain into the river. Fisherfolks also complain that the lack of ventilation has caused inconvenience and health problems. The PWD had initially told the locals that the embankments were temporary. But the project came to a standstill within a year i.e. in 2001 and the PWD eventually never removed the embankments. Many of these houses got partially submerged in the infamous Canacona floods of 2009. The project, which comes under the Union Ministry of Road Transport and executed by the state PWD - has been restarted in 2016, 16 years after the first land-filling. In 2015 the villagers also sent letters to the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority alleging that no permission was taken under the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification, 2011, even though the area is a tidally influenced estuary close to the sea. The PWD then applied for CRZ clearance. An expert member of GCZMA submitted in a field inspection report in September 2015 that the embankment was a cause of concern as it was close to the high tide line and recommended further studies to establish its impact. No such studies were carried out and the GCZMA accorded approval without deliberating it in any other meeting. The fisherfolks report that local PWD officials recently (in mid-2017) gave verbal promises that the filling would be removed and a road would be built on stilts. The fishermen are satisfied with this proposal as it resolves their problems of river access, rainwater drainage and ventilation. But there is no official word on this change in the plan even as work on the road is progressing. The original Coastal Regulatory Zone permission issued in 2015 does not mention a road on stilts, and until the latest (June 2017) meeting of the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority no application has come up for modification of the 2015 permission to incorporate road on stilts.",

The dam is located near village Dargoan in Khariar block of Nuapada district in Odisha. The project will submerge 6288 ha of land ( cultivable 5.245 ha , forest land 1.043 ha ). The project was started in the year 2000 and yet to be operational. The locals allege that the Lower Indra Irrigation Project (LIIP) Authority has failed to suitably rehabilitate people displaced by the dam. The affected families which are now more than 10,000 (the number was 1,460 at the beginning) have been demanding rehabilitation. The administration has closed all the health and nutrition services in the project affected villages in 2009, claiming that the villages have been fully evacuated. The frontline health and nutrition service providers like ASHA, AWW and ANM have also been removed. As a result, thousands of displaced people are now languishing in poverty. The Lower Indra Jan Sachatena Manch, which is the frontline organisation of the project affected persons (PAP), went on a strike in April 2016 and submitted a memorandum to authorities demanding rehabilitation. The demands are also related to policy matters like implementation of the Odisha Rehabilitation Policy, 2006, enhancement of the value of the lands acquired, consideration of women of 18 years and older as displaced persons etc. The Jan Sachetanta Manch has complained that the Government is not considering the demands of the below-poverty-line, project-affected families to restore the supply of rice. Locals say there are many such demands that are lying unaddressed.",

It is estimated that uranium deposits in KPM will last for 25 years. The plan to mine uranium in Meghalaya to address the needs of the nuclear industry in India has run into opposition and protests in the state. Many villages are not ready to give away the land because they do not want uranium mining. Some village residents who are willing to give away the land are demanding a fair rehabilitation and compensation package.

Some part of this slum located on 300 bigha land, is in the name of people who have passed away. Since 1999, this slum has been engulfed in flames at least five times. According to Idrish Ali, the secretary of the Sholo Bigha Bustee Unnoyon Samity or Sholo Bigha Slum Improvement Association, all the residents of the slum have been paying rent to the local mafia to live here. After the fire of 2013, an FIR was lodged against Maheshtala Municipality chairman Dulal Das. Residents of the slum had alleged that it was a deliberate act of arson by the government to occupy slum's land for promoting business. There is no water or legal electricity connection in the slum. The residents don't have any identity proof like ration cards. Idrish Ali had filed a case in Kolkata High Court in 2004 to enquire about the ownership of the land. The court in its verdict on 15th July 2006 ordered Thakurpukur Land Revenue Office to resolve the issue by hearing the case within eight months. The then Government of West Bengal and its Land Revenue minister were among the parties in the case. The settlement records of the year 2000 revealed that the owners of the contested land were Rahamatullah Ostagir, Kartik Kumar Chakraborty, Nihar Ranjan Basu, Ichhan Mollah, Bodhisatwa Das and Basanta Kumar Ray. These owners have died. Idrish Ali has filed another case this year asking that the residents should be given land ownership or land titles. Meanwhile, the state government is constructing affordable houses for the slum dwellers. In the first phase, the government offered housing to 334 families of slum in exchange of Rs 54,000 for a flat. However, residents say that they cannot go because they don't have that amount of money.",

    "summary":"Villagers of Konra in Barhi have started series of protests to get their land back from proposed Barhi Mega Industrial Growth Center (BMIGC) in Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand. The proposed industrial park is a part of Amritsar-Kolkata industrial corridor. The project was conceptualized in 1998 to boost the state's image as a major industrial hub. Ranchi Industrial Area Development Authority (RIADA) acquired nearly 750 acres of land. 500 acres was acquired from village residents. The land acquisition included 221.81 acres raiyyat land and 303.50 acres of gair majurua land. Vinod Vishwakarma, an activist from Barhi has filed a public interest litigation, with the support from affected landowners, in the Jharkhand High Court seeking the return of all acquired land. Vishwakarma points out that a major portion of the acquired land is actually agricultural land. He said, “When the land for Mega Industrial Growth Center was acquired by RIADA, villagers were promised that the families who have given their land for the project will get a job.” Since not a single industrial unit has been set up under the growth center, the families who gave their agricultural land are facing severe livelihood crisis. Village residents say their agricultural land was their source of livelihood. Now, when the agricultural land has been acquired by the government and no industry has been set up leading to create jobs, their families are facing hunger like situation. Activists also underline the Chhotanagpur Tenancy Act and Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act amendment of 1993. “The amendment clearly states that if the industry or establishment is not set up on the acquired land within five years then the land should be returned to the raiyyats,” Vinod adds. The government has appointed IL&FS infrastructure development corporation as a consultant to attract investors. The consultant has also issued series of advertisements to invite expression of interest for the project from all over the country. However, not a single industry has been set up. Consultants have marketed the project site showing availability of adequate water, transport linkage, and availability of cheap labor. The state government, in order to instill a sense of security among prospective investors, offered 101 acres of land to set up CoBRA battalion on the project’s land. CoBRA battalion camp has been already set up. RIADA is now erecting boundary wall around the acquired land. The effort to contact Saughata Maitra, assistant vice president of IL&FS infrastructure development corporation yielded no results. Ram Nagina Sahu, surveyor of RIADA said that a series of spot verification of the project has been done with IL&FS. He informed that project is a part of Amritsar-Kolkata industrial corridor conceptualized by the union government. The role of RIADA was to provide land infrastructure. Since the matter is subjudice, government officials are waiting for the court decision. The cost of the entire land acquisition and infrastructure is around Rs 350 crores.",

    "summary":"In Assam, thousands of people have been displaced by flood and erosion of river Brahmaputra and its tributaries. An estimated 7% of Assam land has been eroded between 1950-2000, resulting in displacement of impoverished people across the Brahmaputra valley. Till 2015, the government didn't have any policy to rehabilitate the victims of riverbank erosion. The same year, the government launched two special schemes but till date not single victim has been benefited. Hence, the erosion-induced internally displaced people are forced to occupy government land, embankments, forest land and sometimes take private land on lease for setting up their slums. About 300 erosion induced displaced families from char (River Island) in Darrang district took shelter in Hatimuria village in nearby Morigaon district in 1998. The displaced Muslim families were offered sheltered by the host Hindu community on humanitarian cause for sometime. The displaced families were supposed to vacate the land as soon as their char emerges. However it took long time but the displaced people could vacate the land. The displaced people negotiated with the host community and got a plot of yearly patta land on lease from the host community. After the 2014 general election, Prabajan Birodhi Manch, an anti-immigrant organization allegedly campaigned against the displaced people and alleged them to be illegal Bangladeshi immigrant. The organization mobilized the host community to ask the displaced people to vacate the land. This erupted into clashes between the IDPs and host community. The district administration of both Darrang and Morigaon stepped in and tried to mitigate the conflict. Morigaon district administration asked the IDPs to relocate to a nearby char called Hiloikhunda which falls in Darrang district. Subsequently, the IDPs moved to new char but the host community claimed that the new char also belong to them and has been used to grazing and cultivation. The local media also published inflammatory news alleging the newly set up huts as settlement of illegal immigrant. Hence, the conflict continued. Recently, Revenue Department of Government of Assam has started evicting the IDPs. First eviction drive was conducted on August and second drive has been conducted on 9th November, 2016. Some of the IDPs has returned to their original char called Gasbari and most of them migrated to other placed.",

The project site is near Tadsaoli Village in Ghatanji Tehsil of Yavatmal District, Maharashtra. It is supposed to irrigate about of 2.27 lakh hectares of which 88% will be in Maharashtra and 12% in Telangana. The ambitious project, which started in the 1980s, has not seen much progress due to a number of reasons including allegations of corruption, court petitions by project affected people and lack of funds. Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) was asked to probe into massive corruption in the project in March 2015. Media reports claim that project's cost escalated from just Rs1,042 crore in 1982 to over Rs17,000 crore in 2015 due to inordinate delays. The total land requirement for the project is 18,826 Ha, which includes 17,186 Ha of private land, 996 Ha of forest land and 644 Ha of Government land. The number of Project Affected villages is 46 out of which 32 villages will be fully affected & 14 villages will be partially affected and the number of project affected families is 8136 in Maharashtra State. There has been a decade-long struggle of the affected people who have refused to part away with both the private and the forestland that they use as commons. They claim their land is very fertile and they have community rights over forests. People have filed Forest Rights claims under the Forest Rights Act but the authorities have not accepted them. The government has given an affidavit in the court that people don't have any forest rights claims in the area.",

The eviction officials destroyed 117 houses/huts, school, Anganwadi center and other amenities. More than 300 people rendered homeless and 120 children are now deprived of getting primary education. The land, under the forest department, was home to around one hundred families mostly erosion affected Muslims and landless Koch Rajbangshi community of Dhubri district. People settled here in 1978-80 after migrating from the Char (river islands) of Roukhuwa Krishtimoni and Solakur, which got washed away in floods and erosion caused by the River Brahmaputra. All the people settled in this land are landless farmers, however, their means of livelihood has changed over the years. Most of the families, both Koch Rajbangshi and Muslims, depend on daily wage earnings to run their families. A large number of these families go for seasonal migration to urban areas and many of them work in the brick kilns in the nearby areas of Chapar. In the last two decades, hundreds of brick kilns have mushroomed in Chapar, most of which are operating in the forest and agricultural land violating environmental rules. However, instead of cracking down on the brick kilns, the forest department evicted 30-35 landless families living in Chnadardinga hill in 1997. The evictees again settled in the area. In October 2016, the state forest minister Pramila Rani Brahma visited the area and instructed the forest officials to evict the settlers. No plan was formulated for rehabilitation for the erosion affected landless people of the area. On 11th November, the forest department sent an eviction notice to the people. Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti mobilized these people into demanding rehabilitation before the eviction. However, the administration didn't pay any attention to the demonstration and protest. On the day of eviction, people plead for some grace period so that they can relocate their belongings. But the eviction officials did not allow them to do that according to the news reports (links given). Two women protested and the forest guards beat them up said the news reports (links given). This infuriated the settlers who started pelting stones on the eviction officials. The police lathi charged and opened fired on the protesters. Five eviction officials got injured.

    "summary":"Lungsung, in Kokrajhar district in the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTAD), is around 10 kilometers from Karigaog on the northern side of the National Highway 31, towards the Bhutan border. In the early 1970s, the Adivasis, mostly Santhal, cleared the forest area and settled in Lungsung. Most of them were either landless farmers or erosion-induced Internally Displaced People (IDPs). Rivers Champa and Sarbag have caused erosion of large tracks of land and displaced thousands of people in the region over the years. Furious River Champa is often called as Pagla Nadhi or the mad river due to its destructive floods. During the early 1970s, a large number of people moved to forests and forest buffer zones. Landless farmers from both Adivasi and Bodo community settled in the nearby villages like Morabari, Bhom Amguri, Pascal, 9 No. Kiyejhorna, Saharjuri, Maharjuri, Radha Nagar etc. In Morabari and Bhom Amgrui villages near Lungsung, the Bodos were able to get land pattas (titles) as well. The Plain Tribes Council of Assam (PTCA), once a strong political movement to assert rights of indigenous plain tribes such as the Bodo, took initiatives in early 1970 to rehabilitate landless Bodo farmers in Haltugaon Division of Reserve Forest. The moment was led by Samar Brahma Choudhury, who was the forest minister under Golab Borbora government in Assam ( Ref: Chainary, Swarna Prabha. “Survival of Boro Language in the Face of Various Challenges.” REMARKING 1, no. 9 (February 2005): 53-57). However, the Adivasis (non-Bodo tribals) of Lungsung lacked the political patronage and faced hostility from the government. The Adivasis living in the area first faced eviction drive in 1972, during the Congress rule, as they were alleged to have occupied the forest land. The community leaders of Adivasis living in Lungsung met the then local Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) and founder of PTCA, Charan Narzary but didn’t receive any protection. The forest department claims that the Adivasis have encroached highly bio-diverse forest, hence they must be evicted from the vicinity. During the 1996 Bodo-Adivasi conflict, the outlawed Bodo terror group attacked the villages and chased away the Adivasis from the area. The Adivasis spent nearly a decade in IDP camps in Joypur (Kokrajhar) and Runikhata (Chirang). Government didn't provide any rehabilitation and the Adivasis started returning to Lungsung from 2003 onwards. In 2006, BTC administration evicted the Adivasis. In 2010, the second round of eviction operation launched which was most forceful and brutal. 56 villages were demolished by setting ablaze the houses and schools and properties were looted (Ref: Dungdung, Gladson. “State-Sponsored Crimes Against Adivasis In Assam.” Countercurrents.org. 14 March 2011. http://www.countercurrents.org/dungdung140311.htm (accessed January 4, 2017). when the forest officials tried to evict Bodo people they face resistance and forced to withdraw the operation. The extent of brutality was so high that a house was burnt while a two and a half yea old was sleeping inside the hut. The boy died in a few months. No action was taken against the officials whereas 33 Adivasis were arrested for protesting. In 2014, the outlawed National Democratic Front of Bodoland (Songbijit) NDFB (S) terror group killed eight Adivasis from Lungsung on the Christmas eve and thousands we displaced (Ref: I did field work in the area and interviewed the survivors and victims of the massacre. I have also examined the charge sheet filed by NIA in those cases. There are multiple news stories available on the massacre. http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bodo-militant-attacks-adivasis-assam-...) In November, the forest department has sent notice to 56 villages and gave 7 day notice period to vacate the land. The Adivasis claim that the forest land belongs to them and they wouldn't leave the land at any cost. While the Adivasis don’t have land pattas (titles), experts claim that, since the villages are forest village, they have rights over the land. as per the Forest Rights Act 2006.",

The Tatas had almost abandoned the land for a long period when their steel project did not materialize because of local resistance. The government acquired the land by applying emergency clause of Land Acquisition Act in 1997-98. The conflict reached its peak in 1996-97, resulting in large-scale arrests and assaults. Tata kept in its captivity about 3,000 acres of fertile agricultural land even after abandoning the steel project. Tata Steel is planning to invest up to Rs 20,000 crore in heavy industries over the next five years for the SEZ. The new SEZ project led to a new resistance movement under Gopalpur Tata Steel Project Affected Framer’s Front. Farmers who had lost 3000 acres of land to Tata and those who had got meager compensation and the ones who got casual employment but later were thrown out of work are now resisting the SEZ project.",

    "summary":"The proposed Lower Suktel Irrigation Project on the Lower Suktel river, hit the news headlines in 1995 when it was made public. The stated objective of the project was to supply irrigation and drinking water to the water starved Bolangir district. As per the plan a dam was to be built on the Jhareidunguri hill near the village Magurbeda. According the Water Conflict sources, a total of 9000 families would be affected by the project. It would submerge 16 villages completely and 10 villages partially, displacing 4160 families including 1222 families belonging to the scheduled tribes. One interesting part about the project is its slow pace of progress and its increasing cost estimates. From Rs 217 crores in in 1996, it has gone up to Rs 934 crores in 2008 and it is now estimated that the cost would go beyond Rs 2000 crores. The Government of India has released Rs. 1,042.81 crores so far for this purpose. As per the present assessment by the Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&R) division of the Water Resources Development, more than 8000 families will be fully displaced. But no convincing resettlement effort on the ground is visible. Apprehending troubles the affected people have revolted against the project. They include Scheduled Tribes (ST) 20 %, Scheduled Castes (SC) 29 % and Other Backward Classes (OBC) 46 %. The project will submerge 1575.15 acres of forest land. It will also submerge thousands of trees which have come up in the course of several generations of settled life in the villages. One of the major income sources contributing to the annual household income in the region is collection and sale of non-timber forest produce. ( Source: Water Conflicts) The High Court on May 18,2016 has rejected the land acquisition notification of the state government on the basis of which it had acquired land in proposed lower Suktel River Dam project. Identifying discrepancies in the land acquisition notification process -a division bench consisting of justice Ms Sanju Panda and Justice Mr. K.R.Mohapatra rejected the land acquisition for the project. At a time when the Lower Suktel project has gathered political storms the judgement comes as a setback for the state government. An affected farmer of Digapati village Sri Prahalad Pradhan had gone to the High Court raising the issues of violations of Clause 4 and 6 of the Land Acquisition Act in the land acquisition process. As per his petition the notification as per clause 4 of the Land Acquisition Act had been issued in December 2011 but the notification for land acquisition as per clause 6 of the Act came in October 2013, where as , the law demands that within a year of notification as per clause 4, clause 6 notification must come out. The Lower Suktel Project began in the year 1995 and it got environmental clearance in 1998. The validity of such a clearance also has been challenged in National Green tribunal and now it is under trial. The locals are protesting against the project. The Project work was resumed in 2013 in the presence of police. About 5000 acres of land from 29 villages had been identified for acquisition. The present petition had been filed in the High Court challenging acquisition 272 acres of land in Digapati village. The Odisha High Court on May 18, 2016 quashed the land acquisition notifications. But there is still tension in the area as as the pro -dam people from Bolangir district are organizing series of activities demanding the state to resume construction work.",

    "summary":"A three-way fight is on in Nagaland between the Central government, the state government and local communities to control land and its resources in the state’s oil belt. The state is projected to have 600 million tonnes of oil and natural gas reserves, which, if fully exploited, could boost India’s onshore oil and gas production by 75 per cent. The state government took over fields abandoned by the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation in 1994 because of protests by Naga groups. Though oil exploration is usually governed by the Centre, Nagaland drafted its own policy—The Nagaland Petroleum and Natural Gas (NPNG) Regulations—in 2012 to wrest control over oil. For this, it used Article 371-A of the Constitution that guarantees no central law pertaining to land and its resources would apply to Nagaland, unless the state’s Assembly ratifies it. The special provision was inserted in the Constitution as part of an agreement between Naga groups and the Central government at the time of the state’s formation in 1963. Using the 2012 regulations, Nagaland allocated oil blocks to a private company, MOGPL, in 2014 and worked out a revenue-sharing model between the state government and landowners. The ministry of petroleum and natural gas has opposed the state’s policy from the time of the erstwhile Congress-led alliance government at the Centre. A section of Naga communities is also opposing the NPNG regulations because they give major share of the oil profit to the state government. The community claims that the Article 371-A gives undisputed rights over land and its resources to the Naga communities and not to the state government. Two years have passed since the MOGPL got the contract for oil exploration but the work could not begin due to people's opposition.",

The dispute is based on the 1875 notification under the foreign department, Government of India. It is difficult to map the exact border according to this notification. Initially, Mizoram accepted its notified border with Assam. The border remained calm till then. Clashes began as Mizoram raised the issue of Assamese encroachment, while Assam protested it. The Assam forest department was seen building houses and clearing forests in areas considered Mizoram territory. Armed confrontation between police of both the states was averted by the intervention of the Home Minister. Tension flared up to violent levels in 1994 and 2007. Mizoram declared that it does not accept the present boundary with Assam and the Inner Line Reserved Forest as described in the 1875 notification under the East Bengal Frontier Regulation of 1873 should be the basis for delineating the border.

The conflict took place when the government instead of complying with Odisha High Court order of 1994, started creating a fence around the land in an area of 1,307 acre. This led to a protest by people from more than 20 villages who united under the banner of Upakuliya Jami O Jangal Suraksha Samithi (UJJSS). They appealed to the government to give them the legal right over the land. On July 15, 2015, the National Green Tribunal stayed the work on the project.

    "summary":"Nearly two-decade old agitation over proposed Netarhat Firing Range has erupted again in Jharkhand. This time tribals are incensed over the government move to create a land bank of nearly 80 acres in the range to attract investors in the state. Irate tribals called for a bandh on March 29, 2017, to boycott chief minister, Raghubar Das public event at Mahautar in Latehar district to highlight the issue of the land bank. Dayamani Barla a frontal tribal leader told Land Conflict Watch that land bank of nearly 80 to 90 acres of once proposed Netarhat Field Firing Range has been created to invite investors and to displace the tribals. She said that government could not muster the courage to displace tribals in the year 2000 when land acquisition began for the firing range. The tribal protest forced the government to take a backstep. “Now the government is trying to enter Netarhat firing range by giving land to the industrialists,” Barla says. The proposed firing range spread over 245 villages was threatening to displace 2.75 lakh tribes including Asur, Birjia, Birhor and Korwa tribes. The issue was also debated in the Rajya Sabha in 2007 when Mabel Rebello raised the issue seeking government’ stand on how displaced tribal families would be rehabilitated. Gladson Dung Dung another tribal activist of Pilot Project Netarhat Field Firing Range Virodhi Jansangharsh Samiti said that nearly 90 percent of the land under the land bank belong to the fifth schedule. The tribal land under the fifth schedule cannot be purchased or transferred. “Moreover, these land are also the property of gram sabha. The government has no right to put this land under the land bank,” Dung Dung adds. Huge support for Mahautar bandh led to the cancellation of chief minister visit. Sub-divisional officer of Mahautar, Om Prakash said that tribal demands have been forwarded to chief minister office and also to the chief secretary.",

The government issued a notification to acquire land of 245 villages in Latehar and Gumla districts in 1993. When the Indian army reached to survey the land in March 1994, the local residents resisted. Due to furious protests by tribals and other locals in large numbers, the army had to leave the spot. Since then, every year on March 22-23, the locals have been organising protest rallies at Netarhat to mark the anniversary of Netarhat Resolve in which they declared they would not part away with their land. The document show more than 3500 square kilometre land is supposed to be taken over by the Army in the blocks of Mahuadarn in Latehar district and the blocks of Bishunpur, Chainpur, Dumri, Ghaghra and Gumla in Gumla district. This land will not only involve privately owned land but also common land. In 1999, the government extended the notification for allotment of land to the firing range till the year 2022. According to the locals, the army tried to survey the land in 2004 but people again resisted. Since then there is a status quo on the project. When asked about the current status of the firing range project, Pramod Kumar Gupta, Deputy Commissioner of Latehar, said it was the same as it was 10 years ago. Nothing much has changed. However most land falls in Gumla district so I can't say much. Shravan Sai, Deputy Commissioner of Gumla did not respond to the phone calls from LCW.",

    "summary":"It's estimated that 57.54 million tons of bauxite can be mined from Surguja. Mainpat has been home to many tribes (Manjhi, Kanwar and Pahadi Korwa), most of whom have derived their sustenance from small-scale farming in the mountainous forest. Bauxite mining in Mainpat Tehsil of Surguja District, erstwhile undivided MP, began in 1993 under BALCO. At the time, 639.169 hectares of land was leased to the company. At the time, hundreds of families were directly displaced, small farms were rendered unsuitable for cultivation and the environment was adversely affected. One figure suggests that out of 112 displaced families, only 50 received compensation. Those who were compensated received only Rs. 12,000 per acre as opposed to Rs. 50,000 per acre which had been promised to them. With the creation of Chhattisgarh in 2000, BALCO's ownership was bought over by Sterlite group (a subsidiary of Vedanta Resources). The new management failed to deliver on the huge amounts of compensation they had promised small farmers and workers. Moreover, they hired more than 4,500 workers but failed to deliver even the basics of what they had promised in their own employment contracts. Bonuses, maternity leaves, housing and education facilities or even basic safety guidelines were reported to be completely absent. In 2007, 45-year-old Jagardev Yadav was reportedly beaten up and jailed for protesting against the lack of rehabilitation by Sterlite for acquiring his land. The same year, Somnath Manjhi - a local resident - had reported that extractive activities had rendered the soil useless and had led to diseases and health hazards for the residents. Since then, reports of unfair employment practices, human rights violations, environmental degradation and failure to offer Rehabilitation & Resettlement have become increasingly frequent, suggesting an unchanging trend. The same was reported in 2010. In 2011, protests against unfair employment practices were staged by mine-workers in Surguja. Despite complaints of rehabilitation and environmental violations filed with government bodies, the mine received both forest clearance in 2008 and lease extension for another 10 years in 2012. In a self-appraisal by the company submitted to Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM) in 2014, Sterlite mentions clearly that out of 26.50 units (presumably hectares) of land due for Resettlement & Rehabilitation, zero units were fulfilled. It is clear that rules and regulations were ignored by one means or another by Sterlite in Mainpat. ​Recently, the trend of social injustice, human rights violations and environmental degradation seems to have continued. In 2016, Patrika reported that the Up-Sarpanch of Kudaridih in Mainpat died of a heart attack after allegedly receiving threats from BALCO executives. He had opposed the reopening of the Kudaridih mine and had received death threats from BALCO executives. Despite a police complaint, little has come out of the case. Due to human rights and environmental violations, Vedanta was blacklisted by Norway's wealth fund in 2017. This year, the company plans to expand bauxite production in Mainpat from 750,000 tons per annum to 2.25 million tons per annum. To secure local consent for expansion, a public hearing was held in April this year, which concluded unsuccessfully. Numerous women and youth of the village gathered to voice their protests against the move, citing public health concerns. Moreover, Attorney Sanjay Ambasht brought to the notice of the congregation that the public hearing was void without BALCO’s fulfillment of a prior High Court order. The High Court had ordered BALCO to fulfill twelve conditions pertaining to environmental, human rights and rural development concerns. The company had failed to address the order and had proceeded with the public hearing anyway. As of now, the expansion of Mainpat mine production cannot proceed. The company has taken initiative toward afforestation, but have only planted non-native monocultures of Eucalyptus.

Jaipur Development Authority had paid compensation to the affected families. But later, the government shifted the truck terminal to a different location on Sikar road. When farmers learned about it, some families refused to take compensation and give away their land. The government deposited their compensation amount in the high court. Out of 538 bigha land, 150 bigha or 25 hectares remained to be acquired. Until 2013, no government scheme was launched on the acquired land. In 2013, the government began the process of acquiring the remaining 25 hectares of land for a township project. Residents who live on that piece of land moved court and got a stay against the acquisition. They say the compensation provided to them in 1992 means nothing given the current land rates, and since township is a new project they should be given better compensation and a proper rehabilitation.",

    "summary":"For more than two decades, the nomadic Van Gujjar tribes residing in Rajaji National park (RNP), spread over an area of 825 sq. km and straddling across the states of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarkhand, have been struggling for their traditional rights. The government have put pressure on them to move out of their forest to live in rehabilitation colonies. In the winter season, the Van Gujjars migrate with their herds to the Shivalik foothills, and in summer, they migrate to pastures in the mountains. The Van Gujjars have had conflicts with the forest authorities, who prohibited human and livestock populations inside the reserved park, and blamed the Van Gujjar community for poaching and timber smuggling. After the creation of the Rajaji National Park, the Van Gujjars were asked to shift to a resettlement colony at Pathari near Haridwar. In 1992, when the Van Gujjars returned to the foothills, the RNP authorities tried to block them from the park area. The community fought back and finally the forest authorities had to relent. There was an eviction notice from Rajaji National Park without a proper rehabilitation package. The Van Gujjars challenged it in the Nainital High Court in 2005. The High Court passed a judgment in February 2007 that the issue should be settled according to the provisions of Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, before which no eviction can take place. Van Gujjars are still fighting against the forest department to get access to the resources in the park under the Forest Rights Act.",

    "summary":"This disputed area is a chapori or riverbank area, which is covered with swamps and uneven land and mostly inhabited by people of Muslim origin. Each year, this area gets severely affected by floods, resulting in acute shortage of communication and transportation facilities. The problem arising with the people residing in this area is due to erosion of land caused by floods. Officially, the disputed land belongs to the government and is earmarked as Professional Grazing Land (PGR) and Village Grazing Land (VGR). People displaced by river erosion in nearby districts started moving to this place from the 1970s. Many politicians from different political parties facilitated the erosion induced internally-displaced people. However, the local Hindu community started opposing the settlement. Two particular Char areas in Sipajhar circle of Darang district, Dhalpur and Phuhuratoli, recently made news. As per the information by the Circle officer of Sipajhar at Guwahati High Court, 215 migrant families encroached on 3,000 bigha (one bigha equals to around 1,600 sq.m) PGR land. On the other hand, 199 families got land allotted in those areas in early 1990s as they were displaced from Barpeta and Goalpara districts due to river land erosion. However, in January 1994, that allotment was revoked by the high court. Last year, Upamanyu Hazarika, the chief functionary of Prabrajon Birodhi Mancha, an anti-immigrant organization, was appointed as commissioner of Supreme Court's One Man Commission on cross border migration and border issues with Bangladesh. Hazarika mentioned in his report that the said villages were encroached by illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. The report created hue and cry. Local ultra-nationalist organizations picked up the issue and held several demonstrations. The people living in the disputed land also filed legal cases against Hazarika in Sipajhar court. These people were supported by All Assam Minority Students' Union and Akhil Gogoi's Krishak Mukti Sangram Samity. From the perspective of conflict, this is very volatile. In 1983, in a nearby char more than 1,000 people were massacred. Some of the victims and family members of 1983 massacre are living in this disputed land. Current situation in the area is also very tense. On one hand, people who are living in the area have nowhere to go, and are ready to fight back any eviction drive. On the other, BJP-led government seems to be committed to evict all the illegal encroachers. Local organizations, including Prabrajon Birodhi Manch, have been putting pressure on the government to conduct the eviction drive as early as possible.",

    "summary":"This is a long pending case since 1992. About 452 farming families were allotted gair khatedari rights, or commons land rights. However, they were not given full khatedari rights. The issue acquired a new dimension when a large portion of the commons land came under the urban periphery of Dungarpur Municipal Council. Now, each time the municipal council plans to undertake a new project, farmers fear eviction. This land is called ‘Chak Beelanam’ and is spread over 7042.3 hectares in 21 villages of three tehsils in Dungapur. It belonged to the erstwhile king of Dungarpur and was acquired by the state government under the Rajasthan Land Reforms and Acquisition of Land Owners Estates Act 1963. While the Act states that the land should be acquired for allotment to landless persons for the development of agriculture, successive governments failed to ensure it. As a result, some occupants are registered only with gair khatedari rights, and several others have technically become encroachers in their own land. According to the state government, the khatedari rights are delayed because the erstwhile king’s family and the state government are fighting a case over the quantum of compensation to be accorded to the families. Vagad Majdoor Kisaan Sangathan (VMKS), a local group, says the pending case has no bearing as far as allotment, regularisation or conferment of tenancy rights to tribal families is concerned. The farmers have been denied their rights and are being penalised and issued notices under Section 91 of the Rajasthan Land Revenue Act, 1956. Following is the number of families affected village-wise: Mandawa-31, Palisoda I-98, Chak Dungarpur-33, Bhandaria-162, Chak Mandawa-15, Ghata-36, Lolakpur-428, Veeri-99, Khaparda I-156, Khaparda II-150, Udaipura-35, Jhinjhava-13, Chundawada-29, Birpur-42, Barothi-50, Chakamhudi-412, Sarkar Kopcha-338, Palisoda II-199, Mandawa I-159, Mandawa II-156, Chakamhudi II-495.",

    "summary":"This age-old conflict has affected about 5 lakh residents. Several governments have attempted to solve it, but the conflict remains the longest in Rajasthan’s urban area. In 1995, Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) acquired land at Prithviraj Nagar to establish a residential colony. The acquisition was challenged at various stages, but the apex court’s order on October 3, 1997 quashed all the charges against JDA. However, the development authority failed to develop the land. The issue became political, and land developers started making illegal colonies here. As the rates were comparatively less and the people involved influential, construction of unauthorised and unapproved colonies continued unabated. JDA made no effort to stop illegal constructions. The developers, on the other hand, tried to get the colonies regularised by submitting penalty. This was taken up in the Cabinet, but the decision could not be implemented because of violations in the area’s masterplan. On September 23, 2002, the state government ordered de-acquisition of the land for the Prithviraj Nagar Housing Scheme. The conflict, now, is between the people living in the area and the government. The government has appointed many committees to solve the problem. In 2012, the Cabinet approved regularisation of encroachments and illegal constructions in Prithviraj Nagar Scheme on payment of a penalty. But many hurdles have come in the way of regularisation. People who lost their land for the scheme and were legally allotted plots have been fighting legal battles.",

District administration has been asking the residents of the settlement to shift to affordable housing provided by the government but people refused saying that the houses build under affordable housing schemes are of bad quality.

    "summary":"Almost 2000 families in Lucknow, the capital of India's northern state Uttar Pradesh, are waiting to get their homes and plots promised to them by Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) long ago. During the 80s, LDA planned a development scheme of building Nehru Enclave -- a new township in Gomti Nagar near Ujariyaon village (now Vaibhav Khand). For the project, LDA acquired land from Ujariyaon village along with other nearby villages. Ujariyaon village also had a land of 9.375 acres owned by a registered cooperative society named Swarg Ashram Sahkari Samiti Ltd. After a failed attempt at convincing the government of Uttar Pradesh to exempt its land from the acquisition, the society filed a petition in High Court challenging the acquisition by the LDA. After the High Court dismissed the petition, the society approached the Supreme Court and got a stay order on the acquisition. Meanwhile, another conflict came up. In 1991 Defense department of the government of India demanded a demarcation of their firing range on the land acquired by the LDA. Till the time allottees of the plots and flats under the Nehru Enclave project along with the society filed individual petitions against LDA. Later, LDA resolved the issue with the society by providing them the similar amount of land in a different location but allottees kept pursuing their case quashing the alternative options given by the LDA. In the year 2013, High Court passed a judgment in favor of the allottees, ordering the LDA to provide them flats/plots in the same promised area. But, owing to the dispute with the department of defense LDA has neither provided the alternate land to the society nor has it complied to the judgment of the High Court about providing the allottees their flats/plots, till now. People affected have constantly been demanding that LDA should comply with the court's order.",

    "summary":"Though the idea of a deep water port at Vizhinjam was floated 2 decades ago, it was only in 2015 that the Adani group (the lone bidder for the project) started work. The port is a deep-water, multipurpose seaport targeting the container shipment traffic. The port is facing opposition from environment activists, fishing communities and the tourism industry over fears of coastal erosion, loss of fishing livelihoods and the impact on the coastal ecosystem. In 2016, a case was filed at the NGT against the port. However, the NGT refused to cancel the environment clearance though it later allowed a review plea to be filed. Activists point out that breakwaters built a few years ago at Vizhinjam have caused coastal erosion. There are also questions of commercial viability considering that another terminal is being planned at Enayam in Tamil Nadu which is a stone's throw away. Opposition to both ports, Vizhinjam and Enayam, continue, particularly from fishing communities. Fishing communities have lost access to the shore and the coastal waters. Going by the experience of fishing communities near other ports, they fear they will be pushed further away from the sea and will loose access to more of their fishing grounds if the port is completed. Some breakwaters have been built and dredging is ongoing at the project site. National fish workers forum has been protesting. In November 2016, the forum held a meeting in Delhi and continue to push the govt to stop this project.",

Applicants wrote several letters to the LDA complaining regarding the same, but received no response. After settling the issues regarding the acquisition with the farmers, LDA started giving the possession of these houses to the allottees along with the registries but the whereabouts of the plots of 123 applicants were unknown even to the LDA engineers. Some of these allottees appealed before the High Court. The high court ordered LDA to resolve the issues and give the plots to the applicants; but due to the absence of a land pool the LDA has not been able to accommodate these allottees even under other projects.",

Chadong village has been completely submerged by the dam reservoir; the other affected villages are Louphong, Lamlai Khunou, Ramrei, Riha and Thoyee. Residents of many villages living downstream of Mapithel dam fled to safer areas after water leaked from the dam. Residents, who include tribal people, are protesting against the alleged forceful displacement. The filling up of the reservoir even before the freshly-filled earth in the diversion channel had fully settled led to leaks and early erosion in the dam. In addition to dam safety concerns, the filling of the reservoir led the Thoubal River to dry up immediately downstream. The villages downstream can no longer fish and collect sand stone brought down by the Thoubal River, an activity that had been their main economic activity. The Mapithel Dam Affected Villages Organization (MDAVO) has expressed serious concern about the missing of two important files on rehabilitation and resettlement for affected communities. The MDAVO petitioned the Manipur government and the Central government, demanding a stop to the commissioning of Mapithel Dam. It has also sought review and investigation of failure and under-performance of all commissioned mega dams in Manipur,such as Khuga, Khoupum and Singda dams and the Loktak Multipurpose Project. They also asked the government to address all pending rehabilitation and resettlement demands and impacts of Mapithel dam before commissioning of the project. They have also demanded the implementation of the recommendations of the UN Special Repporteur on Adequate Housing and Indigenous People’s Rights on Mapithel Dam.",

The school administration is claiming that they had gotten the land registry done for the land in 2002. The matter concerns Uphar Colony in Eldeco. The township has been selling plots since 1992. According to the housing scheme’s blueprint of that time, the land for the park had been demarcated. But suddenly in 1998, the board of this school sprang up. The allottees had appealed before the court but the stay was canceled in 2013. The allottees are now claiming that because the private school had gotten the registry done during the stay period, it would not stand valid.",

    "summary":"Bodoland in Assam has been witnessing violent conflicts for over two decades now. Bodoland Territorial Autonomous Districts (BTAD), an autonomous area for tribal Bodos created in Western Assam under the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, faces multiple problems of ethnicity, religion and race, and land-ownership underlies all these problems. Bodos are one of the most marginalised communities of Assam. They felt alienated from the mainstream Assamese community and demanded separate homeland to achieve their dreams and aspirations. In the course of their decades-old movement, land ownership became an important agenda. Bodo extremist groups started targeting non-Bodos—Muslims, Adivasis, Koch Rajbongshis and others (Assamese Hindu, Bengali Hindus, Nepalis, Biharis)—from early 1990s and drove many of them out. By 2012, more than 115,000 people became internally displaced in the region as a result of the continuing violence, according to conservative estimates. Out of these 115,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs), more than 76,000 are from Bodoland. In 2012, independent India’s biggest displacement happened where more than 400,000 people got displaced and over 100 killed. A large number of those displaced people have not been able to return to their land. The land left by them is being used by influential Bodos. There are instances where politicians are growing rubber plantations on lands once belonging to primitive tribes.",

The proposal of a nuclear power plant and development of a mega tourism project in Sundarbans have been protested by the local population and urban dwellers of Kolkata. Residents have also been fighting against the forest department for their rights on natural resources, but in vain. The major conflicts are around fishing activities and honey collection, traditional occupations that are not permitted anymore, leaving people in a state of poverty. A Public Hearing was held in January 2016 in Sunderban to highlight the condition of the forest dependent fishing and minor forest produce gathering community of Sunderban region. Forest dependent people of Sunderban alleged, before the jury including leading legal minds, social activists and academics, that the forest department was torturing them for extracting honey and other resources from the park.",

It is alleged that documents were made stating that the land was sold before 1956 to private persons. Gundu Rao, the chief minister of Karnataka, purchased the land from benamies. It was later transferred to Gundu Rao’s three sons. One among them is the present MLA and Karnataka Pradesh Congress working president Dinesh Gundu Rao. In 2008, a Joint Legislative Committee headed by A T Ramaswamy identified the land as encroachment. Complaints have been filed in the Karnataka Lokayukta, which has sought a survey report.

By virtue of Section 7 of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, the Elaka became independent on the passing of the said Act. The Meghalaya government is acquiring the land to be used for different projects later but people living there say that it belongs to them and are not ready to give it away. Their rights under the Forest Rights Act of 2006, which recognizes the rights of tribal people and forest dwellers over their forests, have also not been settled.",

    "summary":"Around 20 tribal families that have lost their land during construction of Sikidiri Hydel Power Plant, which is part of he Subernarekha Multipurpose Project, are threatening to stop the power generation at the project. Their decision comes after their repetitive demands for payment compensation for the land lost to the project has not been met for the past 36 years. Sikdiri Hydelpower Station 1 and 2 were completed in 1977 and 1980 respectively. Around 230 acres of land was acquired by tribals of Urba and Karo Byang villages to ensure free flow of water through canals. Displaced tribals were not paid compensation for land acquisition even years after the land was acquired show the court documents. While most of the families shifted to other villages and some took the paltry compensation amount, a section of tribals decided to fight for justice. Around 14 tribal families in 1993 approached Jharkhand High Court to seek compensation amount fixed by the government. In 2002, Court ordered Jharkhand government to pay the compensation as per the rules. However, the state government refused to pay the compensation. Affected tribal families again approached the court in 2004 and filed a writ petition for fair compensation. Court ordered Ramgarh district administration and state government to take immediate steps towards payment of the compensation to the affected families. On 30 June 2012, deputy commissioner of Ramgarh ordered to release a fund of Rs 28.68 lakh for payment to three families. However, the payment was not done till date. On November 11, 2016, MLA, Rajkumar Pahan raised the issue of non-payment of compensation despite court’s order. Jharkhand CM, Raghubar Das taking notice of the issue directed district administration to resolve the issue at the earliest. However, six months after the Jharkhand CM’s order and a year after the High Court order, compensation has not been paid to the displaced families. Angry tribal families are now planning to stop power generation to the hydel plant under the leadership of BJP leader, Rajkumar Bhogta who is also president of Sikdiri Panbijli Sangharsh Samiti. Deputy Development Commissioner of Ramgarh, Sunil Kumar said that administration had prepared budget and even ordered to pay compensation to affected families in 2012. There were few doubts on the number of affected families that needed to be verified. We are in the process of finalising the list of affected families for paying compensation as per the law, he said.",

    "summary":"Displacement issue of SAIL’s Bokaro Steel Plant has once again flared up. Around 25,000 families were displaced in 1960 when the plant’s construction started. Around 800 families were given land in Chas locality just outside the Bokaro Steel City. Descendants of these families, now around 600 families, were never given legal land papers. They were provided a patch of land measuring around 40 acres in return for giving their ancestral villages for the construction of the plant around 40 years back. Houses are constructed on 38 acres of land. Locals claimed that land values would be around 78-80 crores in the market. However, neither the government nor Bokaro Steel Plant took any initiative to provide no objection certificate required to establish ownership of the land to these families at Chas. For years, these families are deprived of selling or even putting up their premises in Chas for sale or any commercial activities. NOC was required to get the land title and to establish land ownership. Since these families have no legal papers they cannot sell or lease their land. Recently, the local municipality decided to collect holding tax, a tax collected from each household as a part of municipality service. Local residents have lodged protests, they blocked the main road and led to a march to the district collector office. Residents allege that after displacement not a single government officer or anyone from Bokaro Steel Plant came to know their situation. Many local resources and community services like temples were set up by displaced families through their own donation. They alleged that municipality wants to collect holding tax on the land that legally does not belong to them. Land holding papers along with NOC are still to be provided by the government. Bharat Lal Thakur, coordination committee member of CPI(ML) has written a letter to the district administration of Bokaro to resolve the issue by providing land rights to displaced families of Bokaro Steel Plant. Chas SDO, Satish Chandra said that a tripartite meeting with the municipality, Bokaro Steel Plant and district administration would be soon held to resolve the issue. “A survey needs to be done to ascertain the authenticity of descendants of displaced living in Chas. Since it’s a five-decade-old issue that would take some time to resolve it,” he said.",

The sources of pollution have been the North Chennai Thermal Power Plant, Manali petrochemical industrial complex. In addition with the construction of the Chennai port, the creek was encroached upon. After years of protest from the fishing community, in 1996, the Madras High Court ordered the thermal power plant to stop dumping fly ash in the creek and to clean up earlier waste that was dumped. But there was no change in the situation; neither did dumping stop. In 2016, using a different strategy of talking about how waterbodies are natural buffers against floods and droughts, the NGT was approached. The NGT has ordered the Buckingham canal be cleaned. And the port was directed to dredge the sand dumped in the creek to convert it to real estate. Two fishing villages nearby were moved years ago from their parts of land. One of these villages is now 2km inland, away from the sea and their boats on land owned by Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation and is under threat from another proposed power plant. The total wetland area in Ennore, as per the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority is 2000 acres.",

    "summary":"In 1970-71, the then chief minister of Assam Mahendra Mohan Choudhury handed over 15,000 bighas of land to landless farmers, cattle herders and erosion-induced-displaced people and almost 1,000 bighas of land to 109 educated unemployed people in Kawoimari forest. These lands were distributed among both Assamese Hindus and Assamese Muslims of Bengal origin. Over time these areas developed into villages with amenities and institutions like schools, irrigation schemes, electricity, houses built under the Indira Awas Yojana, paved roads etc. During the six-year-long Assam Agitation beginning in 1979, a feeling of discord developed between these two categories (belonging to the two communities) and events of riots like setting houses ablaze occurred in Kawoimari. On the 22nd of December 2016, a public meeting was organized by Prabajan Birodhi Mancha(Anti-Immigrant Forum), a local organization that has been pressurizing the government to launch evictions of Muslims of Bengal origin from the government land including the flood-erosion-induced internally displaced people (IDPs) settled by the previous governments. The demand for eviction of Assamese Muslims from this land was vociferously championed at the meeting that was attended by a number of leaders of the All Assam Students' Union (AASU). The AASU leadership also alleged that the people living in the disputed land are of doubtful origin. Whereas the local wing of the All Assam Minority Students' Union (AAMSU) has strongly opposed the AASU rhetoric, saying that the idea of encroachment in Kawoimari is entirely fictional.Although these people have been allotted land, they have not been given permanent land pattas (titles) despite the fact that they have lived over that land for almost 45 years and have paid land revenue. Considering the current political scenario, more than 2000 families of the disputed area are living under constant threat of forced eviction any time. So far Assam government has conducted eviction operations in many places across the state.",

    "summary":"The Similipal National Park in Mayurbhanj district of Odisha, which is inhabited by tribal communities, has been in the news for a conflict between the tribals and forest department. Similipal, which is spread over 2,750 sq. km, was declared a tiger reserve in 1973 and a sanctuary in 1979. In 1986, the Central government proposed to mark 845 sq. km of the reserve as the core area, which would be designated as a national park. Since then, the forest department has been relocating 63 families living in the core zone or using it for livelihood. This drive has led to a series of conflicts between tribespeople and forest department on different fronts. Till now, the department has relocated almost all the villages from the core zone. Only two villages are still resisting. Families from a village named Bakua along with the remaining three families (others were relocated) of Jamunagarh village have been resisting the relocation. Both the villages have received community rights over the Simlipal forest under the Forest Rights Act (FRA) in 2015 along with 41 other villages of the core area. Activists working in the region allege that the forest department has been forcefully relocating the families from the core zone in violation of the FRA. Denying these allegations, Simlipal forest officials told LCW that all the relocations are voluntary. The forest department also plans to relocate 59 villages situated in the buffer zone of the tiger reserve. It has already relocated one village named Kiyajhari from the buffer zone. Residents of the remaining 59 villages are continuously thwarting the relocation. Mankirdias, a particularly vulnerable tribal group of Simlipal forest is also contesting with the forest department to get their habitat rights under FRA so that they can collect not-timber minor forest produce from the jungle to earn their livelihood. Mankirdias are nomads who collect siali fiber from the dense areas of the jungle i.e. core zone. Activists are saying that the district level committee had approved Mankirdias’ habitat titles but in a subsequent meeting, the forest department denied approving the claims and circulated copies of an order by National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) which banned the process of distributing tribal rights in the tiger reserves across India. On another front, a climate of tension persists between the residents of relocated villages and the forest department. In many relocation sites, families have been complaining to the officials for not keeping the promises about providing cultivable land, basic minimum facilities, space for cattle etc.",

    "summary":"The Sardar Sarovar Dam is a gravity dam on the Narmada river near Navagam, Gujarat in India. It is the largest dam and part of the Narmada Valley Project, a large hydraulic engineering project involving the construction of a series of large irrigation and hydroelectric multi-purpose dams on the Narmada river. The SSD is one of the most controversial dam projects in the world because of the massive displacement it entails. However, in Madhya Pradesh, only 40 to 50 displaced families have been allotted land. Even today, 40,000 families live in the submergence zone. There is controversy over the number of affected people. Therefor still many families have not received rehabilitation and compensation. One figure floating around of project affected people is 4,374 families. NBA has said that the process of increasing height of the Sardar Sarovar Dam from 122 metres to 138.68 metres is continuing and due to this 245 villages would face total submergence. The protesters covered villages like Pipalda Gadi, Sala, Nimbola, Khujawa and Dharampuri town in Dharampuri tehsil. Villages in Dharampuri tehsil have been removed from the list of villages that would be submerged by the SSP, although evidences suggest that all these villages would come under submergence after the height of the dam is increased.The NBA has challenged the government’s false affidavits on the question of complete Rehabilitation & Resettlement. The Madhya Pradesh High Court constituted a Commission which submitted its report in 2016 after nearly 7 years. The Jha Commission report is however not made public. People are protesting because they are still deprived of rehabilitation and compensation.",

Although the Machannala Dam is categorised as an irrigation dam, the water for irrigation never reached the villages- Sampoi, Raniar, Varod, Nan Salai, Chansar and Tandi, where the displaced people live.

    "summary":"A high number of tribespeople mostly from Jenu Kuruba tribes and Yerawa tribes were evicted from the Nagarhole National Park just after the implementation of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 (WLPA). According to a report that came out in 2014, a number of 3,400 families were displaced between the 70s and 80s and the majority of tribal communities displaced continue to be landless laborers today. In early 1999, a number of 487 tribal families have moved out of the Park. Initially, 280 families plus 60 families were relocated in Nagapura and Sollepura in 2000 and 2007, for a compensation of one lack rupees and five acres of land. However, the rehabilitation site was not conforming to the needs of the tribal villages. Drinking water and other basic facilities are still not available till yet. In 2010, under the NTCA sponsored scheme of 10 lack rupees compensation, a number of 147 families agreed to relocate to the new site of Shettihali-Lakkapatna and Hebala, in Hunsur district. In response to the forced relocation the tribal got organized under the name of Bubakattu Krishekara Sangha (BKS), and they have been repeatedly fighting against the violation of the Forest Rights Act. In 2008 the tribal people blocked the tourist road demanding for a fair compensation, as they only received barren land and just some thousands of rupees as a monetary compensation. In 2009, the forest dwellers applied for Community Rights under FRA, but till date, they did not receive any community rights. Although Individual Forest Rights (IFRs) were received in most of the case the forest dwellers continue to face harassment from the Forest Department. Between 2001 and 2011, a number of 192 cases against tribal people have been registered. In 2015, it was seen that many people had settled in tents in fringe areas of Nagarhole, and were considered ‘encroachment threats’. In 2016, the tribal forum asked for rehabilitation measures. In May 2017, after the NTCA order against the distribution of FRA titles inside the Core Area, the tribal people protested before the District Collector demanding the withdraw of the unconstitutional order, but till now no response has been given by the authorities.",

Even four decades after the dam was made operational for power generation, many displaced families, specially in the 16 villages, falling in the cut-off area of the Indravati reservoir, in the Kalahandi district, have not yet been rehabilitated. People living are deprived of basic amenities. There is no power supply, drinking water, communication, health and education facilities in these villages. Village residents have submitted a number of memorandums to the authorities demanding better rehabilitation. The affected families had filed a petition in the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in 2014. The petitioner claimed around one lakh people from more than 100 villages in the four districts were living in the cut off area inside the Indravati reservoir. They were deprived of basic necessities such as safe drinking water, primary health care and education. For communication, they had to depend on country boats due to lack of roads. In August 2016, the NHRC had also issued notices to the Chief Secretary of the state and the district collectors of Kalahandi, Koraput, Nabarangpur and Rayagada to submit a report within 15 days for the hearings in the case. It directed the Odisha Government to prepare a comprehensive study on the displaced families, besides providing them adequate compensation and rehabilitation.

By then, people belonging to Tharu tribe who were living inside the protected area had been denied their right to access natural resources such as wood, fruits and other means of livelihood. So now, they became encroachers in their own land. Of the 46 Tharu villages in the area, 44 were relocated under the revenue status. Surma and Golboji villages refused the rehabilitation plan and decided to fight the government. They approached the high court in 1980. However, they lost the long drawn legal battle in 2003. The women of Surma village, then, formed the Tharu Adivasi Mahila Mazdoor Kisan Manch to lead an agitation. Supported by the All India Union of Forest Working People, they started a fight to reclaim their land and acquire land titles. After the Forest Rights Act was implemented in 2006, the people finally got a legal tool to fight the land acquisition and eviction threats. In 2008, Surma was recognised a revenue village. But the conflict is still on as the forest department and the police have refused to implement FRA and are allegedly harassing the people. In April 2016, 75-year-old Bhanduram of the nearby Jaynagar village was arrested allegedly on false charges. He is still in prison.",

    "summary":"Maheshwar hydropower project has been in controversy since its inception, in 1993. It is one of the many dams and hydropower plants planned in the Narmada basin as part of the Narmada Valley Development Project. The project is planned in Jalud village of Khargone district in Madhya Pradesh, and is likely to affect 9,500 families. Led by Narmada Bachao Andolan, residents are demanding re-survey of the project to assess the correct submergence. The project was promoted by MW Corp, the erstwhile S Kumars. As per the project plan, the 400-MW plant would have sold power at Rs 2.64 per unit. But the developer has not started the project yet. The supply rate now is estimated at Rs 11 per unit. The government is not ready to buy power at this rate. The delay in the project has increased the project cost to Rs 6,700 crore, a four-fold rise from the original cost. In October 2014, a committee was created under the state’s additional chief secretary to iron out problems between the private developer, the lender and the Madhya Pradesh Power Management Company. The committee placed three options to end the stand-off—fresh equity infusion by the developer, handing over of the project to a public sector unit, and termination of the existing Power Purchase Agreement. Since the promoters did not manage a fresh equity, there is strong likelihood that the project will go to a government company. Media reports suggest the Union Ministry of Power will now take the final decision.",

From 1973 to 1979 a number of 12 villages, equal to 681 families have been displaced by the Forest Department. In 2002 the relocation project started again. Of the five villages (Pathra, Mordungri, Indala, Khatoli, and Pathra) remaining inside Ranthambore National park, relocation of Pathra village is undertaken. A total of 110 families of Pathra are relocated near Kailashpuri village in Khandar. In 2007, just prior to the notification of the Critical Tiger Habitat in December 2008, the relocation of the other 4 villages remained inside was considered a priority. Between 2007 and 2014 the villages have been coerced by the forest department to move out by accepting the cash settlement package. However, 28 families of Mordungri did not accept the cash and they fought to get land and facilities. They got relocated in 2014 in Girirajpura, but all the promised of schools, health facilities, temples, irrigation facilities and land titles is still pending. The villagers are demanding for proper rehabilitation and for ownership titles. Moreover, with the notification of the CTH the limits of the park expanded and now there are a total of 53 villages that need to be relocated, for an amount of 719.40 crores. In 2016, among the 9 other villages planned for relocation, new 5 villages, vis. Talda Khet, Kala Khora, Gadhi, Maharo and Kiradki, comprising of 260 families, have been identified by priority for relocation to secure the Ranthambhore-Kaila Devi corridor.",

    "summary":"Families affected by the Mandal Dam are incensed over the government plans to resume construction work on the dam. The dam work was started in 1972. On August 8, 1997, sluice gate of the incomplete dam was opened without warning to drive away tribals protesting against the land acquisition for the dam's reservoir. According to Coordination of Democratic Rights Organisation, thirty-two nearby villages were submerged overnight in the resulting floods, and approximately 1100 families were affected. 21 people drowned. A large number of animals died and a lot of people’s property and goods were destroyed. On August 16, 1997, enraged over the deaths of tribals due to flooding, a group of Maoists killed dam’s engineer Baijnath Mishra. By 1997 nearly 90 percent of the dam’s work was complete. Only sluice gates and a part of the embankment needed completion. In May 2016 the Central government decided to initiate the work on the dam. It sent teams for inspection. At present team faces an uphill task of preventing the Palamau tiger reserve from flooding. Nearly half of 1,000 sq km of tiger reserve is expected to be submerged. The government is planning to build an embankment to prevent the tiger reserve from flooding. The project will help irrigate 124,270 hectares of agricultural land in Bihar and Jharkhand. Most of the benefit would be to Bihar’s Aurangabad district, which will receive water for 111,800 hectares of parched agricultural land. On March 21, 2017, a central team comprising of officials from Central Water Commission and North Koel Irrigation Project visited the incomplete Mandal Dam. Resumption and release of water from the dam will displace nearly three villages. Punit Minz, coordinator of Khan Khanij Sangh warned that government is trying to rake up old issues and rubbing salt over wounds of tribals. He said that tribals would launch an agitation and also lead a stir if the dam construction work is started. According to North Koel Project report, the cost of Rs 16-crore project has escalated to nearly 110 crores in the last four decades (http://www.india-wris.nrsc.gov.in/wrpinfo/index.php?title=North_Koel_Maj...). Around 660 families that were displaced during the construction of the dam are still waiting for compensation. These protests are ongoing in the district throughout the year. Saryu Rai, minister for parliamentary affairs, food, public distribution and consumer affairs in the Jharkhand government says that both state and union government would resolve the tribal protest. “Earlier governments have made a lot of mistakes and we are trying to resolve the issue. Since the project also affects a part of the Betla tiger reserve, the final decision of NTCA and SC is awaited,” he said.",

Even though, in 1970, the Indian government ended this method, the people who were engaged in this method were left in the forest. Around 223 people in these villages were granted around 4,200 acres for the purposes of livelihood, with the promise of being given some other place to live, in a few years. However, the forest department did not provide them with any other land and instead began plantation activities on that land. The villagers protested against the forest department as due to the status of the land being forest land, they had neither any land rights, nor any development facilities available to them. They filed claims under the Forest Rights Act, but these claims are still pending.",

However, in March 2016, a division bench of the high court ruled in favour of the government. But occupants of this land are saying that previous Left-front government gave pattas to them for farming. Around 350 families depend on this land. After recent court ruling, government officials tried to plant pegs to formally mark the land, without giving any legal notice to occupants. The villagers uprooted the pegs, saying they have legal barga certificates, issued by the Left government in the 1987. They are demanding if the government wants to take over the land they need to sit with them and discuss the compensation package.

    "summary":"A coal reserve of 210,20 crore metric tons was found sometime ago under Muhammad Bazar block in West Bengal's Birbhum district. The block is to be shared by West Bengal, Bihar, Karnataka, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. About 35 years ago, the then Left Front government of the state acquired 494 acres of the identified land by issuing notices. In 2013, the ruling party—the Trinamool Congress—declared that international tenders would be invited so that mining could begin by experienced agencies. For the beginning of the first phase of the project, 1,000 acres of identified land is required. Of it, 50-60 acres happen to be single-cropped area. The rest is fallow and rocky. A major portion of the land falls under the Deucha Pachami-Hinglo-Bharkata-Kapistha gram panchayats. There are 30-odd adivasi villages on that land, and about 80-90 tribal families reside in each village. The project will displace 10,000-12,000 tribals belonging to Muhammadbazar block. Other than the tribals, 6,000-7,000 people will also be affected. During the land acquisition process, the West Bengal Mineral Development and Trading Corporation promised to give adequate compensation to the affected people. They receive only Rs 22,500 every year as compensation which the affected people say is not enough. Tribals are now saying that they won't part with land. The people who have already lost their land are also demanding proper compensation, rehabilitation and jobs.",

    "summary":"The Bhakra Dam is one of the highest straight gravity dams in the world, constructed on the Satluj river at the site of Bhakra gorge near Rupnagar. The dam has created a huge reservoir of water, called the Gobindsagar lake, which is 88 km long, 8 km wide and has a storage capacity of 9.34 billion cubic metres of water. The Nangal dam has been constructed about 13 km downstream of the Bhakra dam. It serves as an auxiliary dam which serves as a balancing reservoir for taking care of the daily fluctuations from the Bhakra dam. The Bhakra-Nangal multipurpose dams were one of the first river valley projects undertaken in post-independent India and completed in the early 1970s. Close to 36,000 farmers were impacted by the project. Many of them were not adequately compensated and began living and farming in the adjoining forests. Activist Nand Lal Shamra of the people’s forum, Gramin Bhakra Visthapit Sudhar Samiti, says 3,600 families were promised land in Haryana but about 740 of them returned to Himachal Pradesh since they could not be accommodated there. Of the remaining 2,860 families, only 800 could get the ownership of land in Haryana. Many of these families returned to Himachal and settled on forestland without titles. These families are eligible for individual and community rights under the Forest Rights Act of 2006. In April 2015, the Shimla High Court passed an order for eviction of encroachers on forestland. Once again the Bhakra oustees were threatened with displacement, since the Himachal government has been dragging its feet on implementing FRA. A 2016 news report says that 118 plots have been allotted to Bhakra oustees and 250 more are to be allotted plots, which got stalled because of the high court order. Additionally, claims of 1,051 applicants are pending for allocation of 150 sq metre plots in forestland.",

Human habitation exists here. When Kanha National Park was converted into a tiger reserve, people were shifted out of the core area to the buffer zone to create space for tigers. This created villages around the national park. At present, Kanha National Park and Tiger Reserve has 163 villages in its buffer zone. The place has been home to Baiga and Gond tribes for generations. As many as 27 villages have been shifted out of the core area, but were, allegedly, not settled elsewhere. Months after the eviction, families report they received only a fraction of the compensation they were promised. Many others did not receive anything. People now want their land back, not the money. The process of resettling people out of the core area—ongoing since 1967— is slow. Therefore, calculating the amount involved is not easy.",

    "summary":"The Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP), the first integrated steel plant in the public sector in India, was set up with German Collaboration at Rourkela city of Sundhargarh district Odisha. The Orissa government had acquired about 15,000 acres spread across 33 villages for the SAIL-owned RSP and started operation in the year 1959 with an installed capacity of 1 million tons. For over a decade, the steel plant had made losses and the tribals allege that the venture did not expand operations significantly, which spurred the displaced families to demand the unused land. The displaced tribals are demanding jobs for 3,000 displaced persons and the return of 4,500 acres of surrendered land, as also around 4,000 acres of unused land at the Rourkela Steel Plant be returned to the original owners, claiming that the project has not been able to expand operations and does not need the surplus land. On Jan 10, 2006, they have a blockade in the Rourkela city and paralyzed train traffic on the busy Mumbai-Howrah route and then onwards series of blockade made in the city. Dr. Rameshawar Oran, Hon’ble Chairperson of National ST Commission accompanied by the other members of the commission visited Rourkela from 22.02.2016 to 24.02.16 and heard the grievances of the displaced tribals of Rourkela steel plant. On 7 July 2017 the National Commission for Scheduled Tribe sent a directive to the district collector of Sundargarh and directed to stop all construction works, other works and, even tree plantation activities on the unutilized land, which was acquired by the Rourkela Steel Plant.",

Post this judgment, the government gave some part of the land to the State Industrial Corporation of Uttarakhand for industrial purpose and some land to Indian Institute of Management for educational purpose. However, 409 acres of land is still available for distribution among landless people. The government made a list of 60 people who are landless and are to be given land.

    "summary":"Langpih is one of the most under-developed villages bordering the Kamrup district of Assam and the West Garo Hills district of Meghalaya. A beautiful place surrounded by hills and streams, it lacks all-weather roads and basic amenities like education, health, electricity and water. The two adjoining states have been claiming ownership of the village for more than half a century. Former Meghalaya Chief Minister and head of the state’s United Democratic Party, Donkupar Roy, had claimed the village belongs to Meghalaya. The British annexed Assam in colonial times and the village was clubbed with Kamrup district of Assam for administrative purposes. When India got freedom, the village was tagged with West Garo Hills district, which is now in Meghalaya after it was carved out of Assam in 1972, said Roy. Meghalaya claims that the problem started when Assam government set up police station in Lingpih. The conflict over Langpih started in 1974 when Meghalaya police forcefully evicted people of Nepali community from their homes and grazing land. Neplai people, who are mostly engaged in animal husbandry, approached Assam police for justice. Assam police went to the village to investigate the matter and since then the conflict has escalated. Meghalaya again claimed that Assam had encroached the village in 1979. In 1988, the matter reached Parliament. Assam government alleged that Meghalaya wanted to create a new legislative constituency—44 No. Nongstoin—by taking over areas of Assam, including Lingpih. The situation worsened after May 14, 2010, when clashes broke out between Nepali, Khasi and Garo communities. Assam police fired upon the people. Four Khasi people got killed in the firing and at least 18 others were injured. In 2012, 14 people from the Khasi community sat on hunger strike. Administration officials and a huge number of police force were deployed to defuse the situation. But the Khasi people formed a human chain to prevent government officials from Assam from entering the area. At present, the situation is peaceful but the dispute is very much alive. Assam and Meghalaya have 12 land disputes. Meghalaya claims that the official bungalow of Assam Chief Minister at Koinadhara in Guwahati is on land owned by Meghalaya. Former revenue minister of Assam Bhumidhar Barman, on the other hand, had claimed that it was Meghalaya that had encroached 314 bighas of Assam's land. The Central government has tried to solve the dispute through consultations, but failed.",

    "summary":"Days after the Bharatiya Janata Party swept 2017 Uttar Pradesh elections with a thumping majority, party Rajya Sabha member Subramanian Swamy approached the Supreme Court with a request to speed up the Ram janmabhoomi case, which has been pending before the court for six years. Calling the case sensitive and sentimental the chief justice asked the parties to explore an out-of-court settlement. The case revolves around access to a patch of land in Ayodhya. According to Hindu mythology, Ayodhya is regarded as the birthplace of Hindu deity Rama. The contested land had a Babri Mosque which was destroyed during a political rally which turned into a riot on 6 December 1992. Those who demolished the mosque are of the opinion that the mosque was built by modification or destruction of a temple which existed on the same piece of land, which some Hindu groups believe to be the exact place where Rama was born. A subsequent land title case was lodged in the Allahabad High Court, the verdict of which was pronounced on 30 September 2010. In the hearing, the three judges of The Allahabad High Court ruled that the 2.77 acres (1.12 ha) of Ayodhya land be divided into 3 parts, with 1/3 going to the Ram Lalla represented by the Hindu Maha Sabha for the construction of the Ram temple, 1/3 going to the Islamic Sunni Waqf Board and the remaining 1/3 going to a Hindu religious group Nirmohi Akhara. While the three-judge bench was not unanimous that the mosque was constructed after demolition of a temple, it did agree that a temple or a temple structure predated the mosque at the same site. The excavations by the Archaeological Survey of India were heavily used as evidence by the court that the predating structure was a massive Hindu religious building.The Sunni Wakf Board then moved to the Supreme Court challenging the Allahabad High Court judgment. In the Petition, the board had said that the verdict was based on faith and that was not acceptable.

    "summary":"Displaced families of Dimna Dam went on hunger strike on March 2, 2017. Majority of the families have lost their land for the dam but have not been paid compensation, they say. They have been demanding justice for the last seven decades. Around 800 families from 12 villages who were displaced during the construction of Dimna Dam in 1941 are still fighting for their rights. They have formed a group, Jharkhand Mukti Vahini to get compensation for their land that has been either inundated in the dam or forcibly taken away by Tata Steel. State government and Tata Steel constructed the dam through a joint collaboration. Jharkhand Mukti Vahini claims that in the last seven years, around eight meeting have been held with the Tata Steel management but no solution has been chalked out. Around 102 acres of land is still under dispute and its acquisition and compensation is yet to be paid to the affected families. Vahini has been able to get steel major approval that Lalayam and Punsa Village are also facing the erosion threat and thus entitled to compensation. Around 5.83 acres of land in both villages would be acquired under the dam project. Displaced families have prepared a 13-point demand which includes jobs to atleast one member of the displaced families, payment of compensation, medical facilities to displaced families and maintaining basic facilities for the families living at alternate locality after displacement.",

    "summary":"Around 40-year-old Bablu Khan and his 10-year-old son Rahim Khan were buried alive in the underground coal fire zone of Phulauribad in Jharia. Khan an automobile mechanic was working in his makeshift workshop while his son was standing near him. The ground suddenly collapsed, and Rahim fell into the collapsed ground around 20-feet deep. His father, Bablu tried to rescue Rahim but he also slipped inside the ground. The incident happened on May 25th. Bodies of both victims have not been recovered because of the intense heat of underground burning coal. Such incidents have made entire Jharia, a live pyre for thousands of families who live under the perpetual fear of landslide due to underground coal fire in Jharia block of Dhanbad district of Jharkhand. The families are protesting against the irregularities by the state in their rehabilitation, as exposed by the Central Coal Ministry, recently. The underground coal fire has been raging for the last 100 years. The coal fire has led to large scale incidents of landslides leading to house collapses. According to official figures around 190 houses have collapsed and nearly 20 people have died in the land subsidence incidents. There have been incidents of continuous gas emissions from the burning coal fires. Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL) operates coal mines of Jharia. There are around 84 villages in the Jharia coal fire area that are being evacuated and resettled outside the village. The coal mines area is also heavily encroached as coal stealing from the abandoned mines on minor fires are a major occupation for the displaced families. In 2004, Coal India Limited, Government of India and BCCL constituted Jharia Rehabilitation Development Authority (JRDA) for smooth rehabilitation of families that are living in the villages that are already on the coal fire. JRDA was instructed to shift 23847 families of Jharia spread over 8.9 km area to Belgaria where government constructed a multi-storeyed housing complex. JRDA was able to move more than 15,000 families in the budget of 5792.91 crores. A large section of families living in the fire zone had been protesting for long for unfair selection of families for rehabilitation in Belgaria. They had been accusing JRDA of allotting houses to ‘outsiders’ who are not affected by the fire. JRDA meanwhile had been increasing the number of families affected by the fires. It increased the number of families affected by the fire to 91897 and sought a budget of Rs 31,000 crores. Sushil Singh, Secretary, Union Ministry of Coal, recently claimed in April 2017, that the number of families has been unduly increased by JRDA to increase its funding. His report also alleges that notes on the files have been tampered with. The ministry has instructed JRDA to settle only 23847 families that have been surveyed in 2004. Deputy commissioner of Dhanbad, Anjaneyulu Dodde who is also managing director of JRDA in an interview to a Hindi Daily, Dainik Bhaskar, said, “A CBI inquiry is possible into the matter. Deserving families that are affected by coal fire till 2004 had to be relocated to Belgaria but some discrepancies crept in leading to irregularities. We will hold a probe.” Ashok Agrawal, an activist fighting for the cause of Jharia fire zone residents says that more than 10 years have gone by since the Supreme Court passed the order for the immediate implementation of the of the Action Plan submitted by Coal India and others. The time frame was 10 years in which time 56000 families living practically on fire were to have been rehabilitated. What has BCCL got to show. Not even 5000 families have been rehabilitated if at all it can be called a rehabilitation?If the families are not rehabilitated soon then more incidents of residents like Khan is likely to happen. An RTI has been filed to get the copy of the report prepared by the Coal Ministry.",

In 1912 the British Government acquired about 1,700 acres of this land from farmers of about 150 villages to transfer the capital from Kolkata to Delhi. Today some of the descendants of those farmers, relocated in Haryana, are asking for the compensation for the acquired land, claiming they never received anything despite the continuous demands since 1912. In April 2015 and December 2016, two descendants of those farmers-- Mahavir from raisina village and Sajjan Singh from Malcha village-- have filed petitions in the Delhi High court to claim the compensation. Evoking the Land Acquisition Act 2013, these farmers have demanded that either the full compensation should be provided to them on the current market rates or the land in the Raisina Hill be returned to them. The petitioners have estimated that they should receive a compensation of at least Rs 2000 crore. The hearings in the matter are going on in the High Court.",

Out of the 40 claimants for IFR titles over approx. 32 ha. of land, 12 have received them. It has been mentioned that the forest is 120 hectares and the IFR land is 32 ha. It is quite unclear to infer from these figures how much land is the affecetd land. Without any public hearings or Gram Sabha consent, the land has been earmarked by the Forest Department for plantations and this has impacted the livelihood of the local population. Even though no fencing has been done, access to forest for produce has been barred.This situation, though, reportedly woke the women folk up to the importance of Community Forest Rights and the powers they vest with them. The men and women of the village have mobilized for the cause.",

    "summary":"On 10th September 2017, a slum where 22 families resided was demolished illegally with the help of police and local TMC goons beside Subhas Sarobor in Kolkata. The slums were scheduled to be demolished for a “beautification” under Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) project linked to the FIFA U-17 World Cup. The project is being undertaken by the Government of West Bengal Tourism Department, along with the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) and the Kolkata Improvement Trust (KIT). It seeks to provide recreational facilities like a food court, joggers-park, open-air theatre, and the like, while at the same time rendering around twenty-two families living there for more than a decade, homeless. NUJS(NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF JURIDICAL SCIENCES) students under the banner of Increasing Diversity by Increasing Access (IDIA) had filed a PIL with three slum dwellers including Shiv Shankar Ray before the Calcutta High Court challenging the government’s decision earlier in August to stop the eviction, the petition states that the arbitrary actions of the government amounted to a violation of Articles 14, 19, 21 and 300A of the Constitution. Justice Ranjit Kumar Bag granted a stay on the eviction of the slum dwellers. It was also contended that the state authorities were forcing the petitioners and other slum dwellers to evict the area without any notice or rehabilitation scheme in place. The authorities had already begun construction around the area. On 10th September when the student group went with a copy of the court order to confront the government contractor that demolished the slums despite the order, female NUJS students were allegedly groped and male students were assaulted until they fell unconscious. All their phones were smashed and completely destroyed by the goons. When the students tried to escape, the gates of the area (Subhas Sarovar- where the slum is located in a fenced enclosure) were shut and the goons continued to assault them. Some of the female students were allegedly threatened with rape by faces in the mob. They had been taken to the police station with slum dwellers and police has threatened to file serious charges against them. According to slum dwellers when TMS goons were beating them up there was no police. On 11th September advocate Aniruddha Chatterjee, appearing for petitioner Shib Shankar Ray, who had moved HC earlier seeking a stay on the eviction of the families living there, told justice RK Bag that the action to demolish the shanties -- home to the families for nearly four-decades -- violated his August 24 order. The Calcutta high court asked the KMDA to ensure that all 22 displaced families are rehabilitated in a Kolkata Improvement Trust (KIT) plot near Subhas Sarobar and gave it 24 hours for that. The HC order came in the wake of KMDA's proposal to rehabilitate all the affected persons. The KMDA, however, claimed it had no role in the attempted eviction the night before. Currently, they have been rehabilitated but without any basic facility.",

    "summary":"Each year, around 12,000 Agariya families migrate to the Little Rann of Kutch for a period of eight months (from September to April-May) for salt farming. The Agariyas are nomadic and denotified tribes. In 1948, Government of India had declared that small-scale salt farmers, who have less than 10 acres or 4 hectares of land, do not require lease to make salt. But after Little Rann of Kutch was declared a sanctuary in 1973, and technically became a forest, the forest department allegedly started haressing them for using its land to make salt. But the salt farmers say that they have been farming salt here for generations. They demand their customary sesonal user rights to farm salt in Little Rann of Kutch under the Forest Rights Act. They have submitted applications demanding these rights to the local government bodies but have not heard anything yet. The average land use by each salt farmer is just about 4 or 5 acres and they claim that they do not use more than 3% of the total land of the sanctuary. In 2013, Gujarat government issued a resolution saying that the government has initiated the process to create Forest Right Committees in the area for this purpose. No action has been taken so far by the committees. About 5,000 sq km of Little Rann of Kutch has never been surveyed, so there is a lot of confusion about ownership of the land.",

The other blocks of the district like Padrauna, Hata and Kasya are also severely affected every monsoon. Two months back the people of Tamkuhi, with support of the local MLA Ajay kumar Laloo, agitated for commencement of the flood relief work before the monsoon rain. They demanded that the dam be repaired. The dharna lasted for almost a week, ending when the irrigation department officials visited the affected block and the bank of Gandak river. The officials had started flood relief work so as to change the path of the Gandak river. When Nepal releases flood water it flows into and ends up swelling the Gandak. A boundary separates the water catchment zone of the Gandak in the North-East side and other streams towards the South-East. MLA Ajay said that even though the department had started the relief work, the locals were not satisfied with the progress. He said the dam had been badly damaged in the last flood, and the pace of the relief work was very uninspiring and the process quite unorganized. If the department did not expedite the work then they will soon resume their agitation. The locals had previously demonstrated by means of a ‘Jalsamadhi’ in the river, whereby they half submerged themselves in the water as a way of protest. They had also held a dharna protest outside the block offices. The MLA said they won’t wait any longer and get started with their protests again unless the irrigation department made adequate arrangements to safeguard the block from submerging this monsoon and sustain similar damage as the preceding years.",

    "summary":"Residents of Bairia constituency in Ballia of Eastern Uttar Pradesh formed a 7 km long human chain to protest against administrations' inactivity in making requisite preparations for saving the region from the floods that wash away entire agriculture land along with the houses, every year. Every monsoon Gandak and Saryu rivers start flowing above the danger mark which results in overflowing of Ring dam. Dam is the only waterbody which saves the villages from flooding. Once the dam starts overflowing, water enters into all the villages submerging 50,000 hectares of land in Bairia Mandal affecting 10,000 families. Residents of Bairia mandal have been requesting the administration to strengthen the Ring Dam. Owing to the apathy of the district administration people started protesting. Still recovering from the devastation caused by last year's flood the threat again looms over the residents of Bairia mandal.",

The Farmers' body says that villages like Dandi, Mor, Delasa, Mandroi, Karanj, Nesh, Saras, Koba, Lavacha, Kudiyana in Olpad are worst affected by these shrimp ponds, which have been constructed near the coastal border. That has left no or little space for the rainwater to flow into the sea. This causes flash floods, which may destroy the standing crops and houses in the villages, say residents of these villages. They are asking the government to remove these ponds. One Smit Aquaculture Private Limited has allegedly captured around 800 bigha government land at Dandi village and developed over a thousand shrimp ponds. Apparently, farmers have been voicing their concerns against shrimp ponds for over four years but the government is yet to take any action.",

A survey is being conducted to find out how many Maldharis have returned and are residing inside the Gir National Park. The state forest department says that Maldharis and livestock have had a negative impact on lion habitat due to overuse of both forest product and fodder. The department is putting pressure on Maldharis to leave the park fringe areas, where they are settled now. Although Maldharis have not started any kind of organized protest, minor scuffles keep happening between them and the forest department.",

Taking cognisance of this, the Rajasthan High Court instructed the Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) to identify the encroachments near the walled area. Records show JMC has identified 1,868 houses or shops constructed within 5 metres of the parkota, or the heritage wall. Owners of these houses or shops allege that JMC has not redressed their problem. Rather, it has issued notices to demolish the constructions. The case goes back to 1953 when refugees from Sindh were allotted shops near the heritage wall. The prescribed size of each shop was 10x24 feet. There was a 6-feet walkway between the shops and the heritage wall. In 1978, the rehabilitation department sold this 6-feet walkway to the shopkeepers for Rs 1,000 each. The shopkeepers gradually extended their shops, which now touched the heritage wall, and are of the size 10x30-35. While JMC has declared these constructions as encroachments, people say the land was allotted to them by the state government so JMC has no right to oust them. The demolition will reportedly affect about 10,000 people and 5,000 houses.",

Over 22 villages are likely to be affected by this 380-km road project. In June 2016, around 35 people were detained to prevent them from protesting when the National Highway Authority of India reached one of the villages for measurement activities. There have been reports of stone pelting and light lathi charge; the measurement activities were carried out in spite of the protest. This land acquisition will lead to loss of livelihood of over 250 families in these villages as their main source of income is agriculture. Even though the government has promised land in lieu of land and house in lieu of house to affected families, till now, government officials have not taken any steps to ensure that. As of June 2016, the news reports said the project got all mandatory clearances, However, NHAI officials stated that they are continuing to face resistance from landowners.",

    "summary":"The 243 MW Integrated Kashang Hydroelectricity Project is proposed on the Kashang and Kerang streams—the right bank tributaries of the Satluj river—In Morang Tehsil of Kinnaur district, Himachal Pradesh. Kinnaur is a Schedule V area under the Indian Constitution with a high percentage of tribal population. The project was initially conceived in 2002 as a 65 MW project. Later, three more projects were integrated with the initial design for the Rs 1,800 crore project to be executed by state-owned Himachal Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd (HPPCL). The first three stages of the project are now being funded by the Asian Development Bank as a part of the Himachal Pradesh Clean Energy Development Investment Program. HPPCL has awarded the construction contract of stage-1 work to Hindustan Construction Company for Rs 296.90 crore. It involves construction of a 65 MW power station and also includes preparatory work for two subsequent stages which involve installation of two turbines of 65 MW each and space for one more turbine of the same capacity. At present, stage 1 of the project is under way; stage II and III components of the project have received environment and forest clearances from the Central government, but these have not started because of strong local opposition. Local communities have challenged both clearances in the National Green Tribunal. For stage-IV of the project, forest clearance is yet to be obtained. Kashang Stage-1 was also opposed. Residents of the affected Pangi village challenged land acquisition for the project in the court. HPPCL arrived at an out-of-court settlement with the affected people and enhanced land compensation rates in Kinnaur and fixed it at Rs 1,04,000.000 per biswa or Rs 20,00,000.00 per bigha (one bigha equals 1,621 metre), in keeping with the demand of local people. These rates are followed in all land acquisitions in Kinnaur district. HPPCL was also forced to pay Rs 70,000 to each family that had right over the forestland being diverted for the project. This was the first time any project developer paid compensation for diversion of forestland in Himachal. The major opposition against stage II and III of the project is from the affected residents of Lippa and Rarang villages. They are demanding scrapping of the part of the project for diverting water of Kerang through a link tunnel to the Kashang stream. The major contention of the residents is that the water of Kerang stream washes off the debris brought by Taiti stream (a tributary of Kerang stream) and once water of Kerang stream is diverted, Lippa village would be buried under the debris brought by Taiti stream. There are close to 150 natural water springs in Lappo area where the diversion weir with four tunnels for stage-II and II will be constructed; 80 per cent people from Lippa village have agricultural land and apple orchards in this area. Without the natural springs, it will be not possible for the local community to cultivate in this cold desert area. There are other reasons for opposing the project. These are: •Morang tehsil is the abode of Chilgoza pine—a rare endangered tree species. The forest area of 63 hectares which is going to be diverted for the project has Chilgoza pine as the dominant species. •Violation of critical legislation like the Forest Rights Act and Panchayat (Extension to Scheduled Areas Act (PESA). •The poor quality of the environment impact assessment EIA report, prepared by the Indian Council for Forestry Research and Education, Shimla. The local community challenged the forest clearance before the National Green Tribunal. The tribunal, in its May 4 order, directed the state forest department and the Union ministry of environment and forests, which allowed diversion of 17.7 ha of forestland to ensure that the entire proposal pertaining to the forest clearance is placed before the gram sabha of Lippa, Rarang, Pangi and Telangi villages. In September first week the HPPCL challenged this order in the Supreme Court but later the Himachal Government withdrew the case after pressure from the All India Congress Committee, which told the court that it was committed to implementing the Forest Rights Act of 2006, which recognizes the rights of forest dwellers over forestland.",

The dam, once completed, will submerge villages along the Sabari river in Konta block of Chhattisgarh’s Dantewada district. In Odisha, villages along the Sabari and Sileru rivers (tributaries of the Godavari) in Motu block of Malkangiri district will be submerged. Estimates of the number of people who will be displaced by the project vary between 200,000 to 400,000. The Andhra Pradesh government has suggested constructing 30.2-km-long protective walls in Odisha and 29.12-km-long walls in Chhattisgarh to avoid submergence. The Odisha government has filed a plea in the Supreme Court against the project. The matter is also pending in the National Green Tribunal. The Odisha government has rejected Andhra Pradesh's request to conduct a public hearing on the Polavaram project. The Odisha government cannot conduct a public hearing at this stage without the direction of the Supreme Court, says the state forest and environment secretary, Suresh Chandra Mohapatra. Odisha says the Centre gave statutory clearance to the project without a public hearing and ignored the state government's objections.",

    "summary":"The conflict between the two states of Assam and Nagaland mostly relates to land encroachment. During the creation of Nagaland state, an agreement was signed by the Naga People's Committee and the then Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. Some of the clauses in the agreement on land transfer to Nagaland remain unimplemented till date and have become the underlying reason for the conflict between the two states. Assam and Nagaland share a 434-km border. This interstate border is divided into six sectors—A, B, C, D, E and F. These sectors include Sivasagar, Golaghat, Jorhat and Karbi Anglong districts, all of which presently lie in Assam. The Nagaland state claims that sectors A, B, C and D belong to the Naga tribes and should not be a part of Assam. During the colonial rule, the British Government made these sectors a part of Assam for administrative convenience; these were supposed be transferred to Nagaland state after its creation. However, till date no such transfer has been made and the Assam government, which claims that since there has been no direction from the Central government in this regard, no steps shall be taken for carving out the districts demanded by Nagaland. This age-old dispute has given rise to violent conflicts, leading to mass killings and displacement and remains a constant issue of concern, most of which are carried out by the extremist National Socialist Council of Nagaland/Nagalim. Talks were held between the two state governments to settle this dispute, but these have not led to any solution till date.",

The Rs 3,000-crore ICTT, being built by DP World, a private firm, was termed as a ‘project of national importance'. Rema Devi, who, as deputy collector (land acquisition), supervised the Moolampilly acquisition, was reported to have said that the administration had no other option but to acquire the land because of the pressure from the then Central government. The families who refused to give away their land because they were unhappy with the compensation were forcibly evicted. Gradually, peoples' struggle gathered momentum, pressing for rehabilitation and compensation for the evicted families. It was a standoff between 300-odd families' right to rehabilitation and a region's need for development. The agitation forced the Left Democratic Front government to set up a Cabinet sub-committee to address the issue. After rounds of negotiations,the committee substantially increased the compensation, and various other amenities were promised including land plots, water and electricity. The package was extended to all the 326 families evicted for the highway and rail link. Recently, the evicted families were given land for housing but there is no road connectivity. Water and electricity connections are not there. So, most families have not constructed houses and are still living in rented accommodations or with relatives. Note: The researcher has verified the conflict by talking to people on the ground.",

It is made of five revenue villages, Khurpiya, Bandia, Devriya, Gorikala and Bhuragori. Keshar enterprises was the lease holder of this 1,500-acre farm. The landless people of Kumaon have been demanding land for themselves from this farm. In 2012, the High Court asked the government to take the possession of this land. After 4 years government passed an order that a Sidcul Industrial Estate will be set up on 1002.15 acres from five villages of Khurpia farm. The remaining 485 acres will be distributed among the landless. However, this was never implemented. People are protesting and sitting on a hunger strike to get the land.",

It is a popular destination for tourists and offers sports activities like skiing and paragliding. The order to demolish the shops has hit the local people hard. According to a press note issued by Himalaya Niti Abhiyan, a people’s forum, these shops provided a means of living to over 6,000 people besides a large number of migrant workers.The tribunal’s order was passed in view of environment protection, but while implementing the orders the state did not take steps to provide alternative livelihoods to people or consider environment-friendly tourism to protect the interest of poor workers and locals, the forum says. Many families operating dhabas lived in them or in a small rooms adjacent to the eateries. In recent times, on follow-up orders of NGT, the Himachal Pradesh Pollution Control Board has taken action against illegally operating tourist joints as well.",

    "summary":"On April 6, 2015 the Himachal Pradesh High Court ordered the removal of encroachments in forestland in the state within a period of six months.The court has since issued several orders for removal of encroachments, triggering an eviction drive by the state forest department. The department served notices for removing encroachments and disconnected electricity and water supply to the structures raised “illegally” on encroached land. The order of the high court is unclear on the rights of the affected people under the Forest Rights Act (FRA) of 2006; the Act gives forest dwellers and indigenous people rights over forestland. As a result of lack of clarity in the order, the forest department is removing encroachments without excluding the areas that fall under the purview of FRA. Activists say the state government failed to bring the issue of non-implementation of FRA to the court’s notice. FRA implementation in Himachal Pradesh has been rather slow. According to Section 5 of Chapter III of FRA, “No member of a forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribe or other traditional forest dweller shall be evicted or removed from forest land under his occupation till the recognition and verification procedure is complete.” The state government has shown no will to implement this Act, especially when the plan to regularise occupation of forestland dates back to 2002, when the then Bharatiya Janata Party government in the state had announced that occupiers should file their affidavit for recognition of their land rights. This was not implemented by successive governments in Himachal. The fact that from Kinnaur district alone thousands of claims were filed in that year shows that the forest settlements date back to before 2005, which make the residents eligible to claim rights under FRA of 2006. Several organisations in Himachal have been campaigning for the speedy implementation of the Act. One such people’s organisation, APMC, has raised questions about the non-implementation of the 2002 regularisation policy and evictions. It says a total of 221,807 applications for forestland rights are pending with the government. Of these, 46,388 are from Kangra, 13,459 from Una, 13,888 from Hamirpur, 32,810 from Mandi, 63,507 from Shimla, 9,857 from Chamba, 3,571 from Kullu, 2,678 from Lahaul-Spiti, 8,427 from Solan, 11,749 from Bilaspur and 2,154 are from Sirmaur (for Kinnaur, no accurate data is available). Recent reports indicate that 5,409 individual claims and 283 community forest right claims had been filed in Himachal, of which 238 individual claims and 108 community claims were settled. But these grant rights over plots measuring just 0.35 acres (115 sq metre) in cases of both Individual and community claims. This is in spite of the affidavit submitted by the central Ministry of Tribal Affairs before the Himachal High Court, which says the state government has constituted forest rights committees in 14,206 of the 18,055 revenue villages.",
